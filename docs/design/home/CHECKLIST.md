# Home — Checklist

## The common record

- [ ] **C1** — The home record is Pi's session tree: a home file parses with Pi's parser unchanged, and lys's harness events and call records are custom entries.
- [ ] **C2** — Content blocks are stored once by SHA-256 and referenced; an identical block put twice occupies one entry.

## Claude Code in and out

- [ ] **C3** — A Claude Code JSONL imports to events: user turns, assistant turns with tool calls, tool results, compaction summaries, and sidechains as child branches; harness bookkeeping records are counted and left in the byte-for-byte original.
- [ ] **C4** — Events render to a Claude Code JSONL under a chosen uuid at the harness path, with a loss account beside it.
- [ ] **C5** — Provider-native opaque blocks are kept whole, keyed by provider, model family and branch, and rendered only to their own provider with the intervening events.

## The two proofs

- [ ] **C10** — A hand-written few-shot session file resumes Claude Code by path from a directory outside the config root; the source is unchanged and the session reports authored.
- [ ] **C6** — One real session imported, rendered and resumed with --fork-session on Claude Code 2.1.281: it continues, no completed tool action repeats, the original's hash is unchanged.
- [ ] **C7** — One seat with a subscription login completes a call through a pass-through proxy; the measurement is written down.

## The two captures

- [ ] **C8** — Claude Code's harness-local records (hook outcomes, permission mode, tool completion) become lys.harness_event entries attached under the message entry they followed.
- [ ] **C9** — A proxy call record (lys.call) names its request and response blocks by hash with provider, api, model and timing, and can be ingested from a captured request and response pair.
- [ ] **C11** — The little proxy passes Messages, Chat Completions and Responses streams through unchanged and appends one lys.call entry per call under the session it links to.

## The handover

- [ ] **C12** — At compaction or retirement the outgoing session's letter to its successor, with its real thinking, becomes the successor's first entry as lys.inherited; it is never authored and replays only to the same provider, api and model; seeded against plain is measured on a card.
