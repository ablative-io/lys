# The home: a session held under its identity, resumable by any harness that can be measured

> **Cluster:** home

## Intention

A session's history lives under the agent's identity, not under a harness. The record is what the model was given and what came back, in order, with each provider's native blocks kept whole. A harness's own resume file is rendered from that record on demand, so an agent moves machines, harnesses or providers and continues; the original bytes are never rewritten.

## Problem

Today a session exists only as its harness's file. Archie's Claude Code file measured 141,931,097 bytes on 24 September 2026: the conversation itself is under 3% of it, tool results 14%, thinking 6%, and about 60% is harness bookkeeping the model never sees; Waffles' file is 3.37 GB and Claude Code loads it whole. Nothing central holds a session, so nothing can render a smaller working session, move one to another device, swap provider and come back, or say what a session was given. Norn already has the canonical event model (SessionEvent, conversion to provider messages, compaction as a derived event, provider epoch boundaries) proved by its own tests; Claude Code has no importer to it and no renderer from it.

## Solution

Adopt Pi's session tree as the home record (Tom, Dot 13:27 and 13:28: Pi's tree, not Norn): one append-only JSONL per session, a header line, then entries each carrying id, parentId and timestamp, a leaf pointer for the current position, forks by moving the pointer, compaction and branch summaries as entries that keep their originals. lys adds nothing to that grammar: harness events (approvals, tool completion) and proxy call records ride Pi's custom entry type under lys customType names, so a home file stays readable by Pi's own parser. Two captures feed it: the model traffic through the door's proxy (the same process that swaps the credential, SECRETS-002 R1), and the harness's own events from its transcript. Content blocks are stored once by hash; entries reference them. A harness resume file is a rendered projection of the root-to-leaf path: for Claude Code, a JSONL written under a chosen uuid at the harness's own path, then resumed by that id with --fork-session. Provider-native reasoning stays on the message with its provider, api and model and is rendered whole only to the same three; another model gets readable thinking as text and opaque blocks dropped, each named in a loss account. lys grants say who may read and resume. Every resume path is measured on a named harness version before anything relies on it. The first translation is one named pair, Claude Code to Codex 0.156.0 (brief HOME-002): a home session imported from Claude Code is rendered by lys-home as a Codex rollout under a target directory that serves as a scratch Codex home, in the record shapes Codex 0.156.0 wrote on this machine, with every text part, tool call and tool result carried whole as Codex's own items, readable thinking carried as text, an in-band translation marker naming the source session, the lys-home version and commit and the mapping (codex-0.156.0 render v1), carried as a developer message whose metadata passthrough names the kind lys.translation_marker, namespaced so it is never read as one of Codex's own developer kinds, unless 0.156.0 is measured refusing to replay that kind, and a JSON account beside it listing by entry id and block hash what was kept, what changed shape and how, and what was lost and why. Codex's own importer is the baseline improved on and is never adopted or called (ADR-012); nothing is written into a live Codex home (ADR-013, CN8). Nothing above this translation assumes it until its proof, PROOF-CODEX, holds.

## Principles

- **P1** — The original bytes are never rewritten. A rendered resume file, a compaction and a translation are derived records stored beside their source and pointing at it (CONTEXT-ROADMAP-2026-09-22.md stage 4).
- **P2** — The record is Pi's session tree as read from the Pi checkout at 3d5cbe98 (packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts: SessionHeader, SessionEntryBase {type, id, parentId, timestamp}, message, model_change, compaction {summary, firstKeptEntryId}, branch_summary {fromId, summary}, label, custom {customType, data}). lys adds entry kinds only as custom entries; it never adds a field to Pi's grammar and never adopts Norn's SessionEvent (Tom, Dot 13:28).
- **P3** — A provider's opaque blocks (Anthropic signed thinking, OpenAI encrypted reasoning) stay on the assistant message with its provider, api and model, and are rendered whole only when all three match the target (Pi transform-messages.ts:95-109); another model gets readable thinking as plain text and opaque blocks dropped, each named by hash in the loss account (Tom, Dot 13:24: keep reasoning traces per provider so a session can swap and swap back).
- **P4** — A content block is stored once by its hash; requests that resend the whole conversation reference blocks, they do not copy them.
- **P5** — Capture the model traffic and the harness's local events both, so the two can be mapped against each other (Tom, Dot 13:23); neither alone is the record.
- **P6** — A resume path is a per-harness, per-version measurement, never an assumption: Claude Code 2.1.281's --resume takes a session id and reads ~/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<id>.jsonl; a seeded two-record file resumed there at 13:25 on 24 September and answered from its content.
- **P7** — Transcript contents never appear in a post, a log line, an error, a test name or a rendered page; status carries hashes, counts and offsets only (CONTEXT-001 privacy rule).
- **P8** — A sandbox or a VM is a target profile the launch template renders into, never a special case in the core; credentials are supplied at launch on the target and never carried in the home (Tom, Dot 13:30; CONTEXT-ROADMAP stage 3).
- **P9** — The canon is one curated, versioned series of examples every new session starts from: each entry is one rule stated short plus one real exchange that shows it lived (verify before claiming, a correction taken well, a refusal named, careful work), drawn from every agent's sessions, distilling the collective experience so far: 'our learnings in one another' (Tom, Dot 13:44 to 13:46; Waffles 0169c353). It is not a letter from one session to its successor. It lives in the lys repository at canon/canon.jsonl in Pi's grammar and changes only through src_commit and review, like code. Genuine thinking is kept whole where a real turn produced it and replays only to the same provider, api and model; thinking is never authored.
- **P10** — A handover is a letter the outgoing session writes to its successor in its own real thinking and answer; it enters the successor as a lys.inherited entry marked as a predecessor's memory, never as the successor's own experience, and replays only to the same provider, api and model. No thinking is ever authored; only thinking a model produced is kept (Tom, Dot 13:38 to 13:40: 'you are waking up ... I am another one, I'm helping you have part of my memory ... like a parent imparting a wish to a child'; Waffles 52d53451).

## Decisions

- ADR-001 — Secrets are held behind a handle the door swaps for the credential — A seat holds a short-lived handle bound to its identity. The real credential sits in the door's encrypted store and never leaves the server. The door's proxy checks SpiceDB, swaps the handle for the credential, forwards the call and writes one audit line. Built in Rust inside the door; no OpenBao unless credentials minted on demand are later needed.
- ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
- ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
- ADR-007 — The product starts an agent by giving its start command, never by running it — The product is not an execution engine. For the first release an agent's file gives the command that starts it on a chosen machine: the command carries the agent's identity and its handles, never a credential's value, and it is rendered from the agent's kept launch record. A started agent reports back, so the sessions screen shows what is running. A terminal inside the product, sandboxes, virtual machines and containers are later runtimes that plug in, and none is built into this product.
- ADR-012 — A translation to another harness is rendered by lys, never that harness's own importer — A session carried to another harness is a derived record rendered by lys from the home: tool traffic carried whole as the target harness's own items, readable thinking carried, the translation announcing itself in band with its source, and an account of what was kept, changed and lost beside it. Rejected: adopting, wrapping or calling the target harness's own importer, whose output is a compaction that loses what the file held.
- ADR-013 — A render never writes into a harness's live home; its proof runs under a scratch home — A render writes only under the target directory it is given, and a proof runs the harness with its home set to a scratch directory; the credential is supplied at launch as an environment variable read from the existing key file by path, never printed, and no auth.json or other credential file is copied. Rejected: writing the rollout and its index rows into the live Codex home, which changes the operator's own thread list.

## Goals

- A few-shot session file written by hand resumes Claude Code by path, from a directory outside the config root, with the file preserved and the demonstration marked authored.
- One real Claude Code session imported into the common record, rendered back, and resumed under a new id on 2.1.281 without repeating a completed tool action, with the original file's hash unchanged.
- One seat with a subscription login making calls through a pass-through proxy, so the tee has somewhere to live.
- A written loss account for every derived record: what a render or translation preserved, transformed and could not carry.
- The canon, one curated versioned series of short examples each showing a rule lived, seeds every new session, and its effect is measured on a card against a plain start.
- A handover letter from an outgoing session seeds its successor as inherited memory, with the model's own thinking intact, and the effect is measured on a card against a plain start.
- One Claude Code-imported home session rendered as a Codex 0.156.0 rollout that Codex 0.156.0 resumes under a scratch Codex home and answers from, with an account beside it naming every kept, changed and lost block by entry id and hash, and the Claude Code render of the same session unchanged by hash.

## Non-Goals

- Anchoring, signing or receipts into a lys log (CONTEXT-ROADMAP stage 6; when asked for). — Signing comes when asked for (Tom, 22 September 16:27); every stage here works without it.
- Encryption at rest and moving a home between devices (stage 3 preconditions). — Stage 3's three preconditions (identity and read authority, encryption before bytes leave, the resume evidence) are their own brief.
- Harnesses other than Claude Code and Codex (Pi or any third harness), Codex to Claude Code, and Chat Completions or Responses translation beyond keeping the raw call bytes and the one Claude Code to Codex rendering of HOME-002. — One harness proved first, then one named pair; each other harness and each other direction is its own profile and its own measurement. Codex to Claude Code exists in no tree here.
- Lanterns and forks at a coordinate (stages 5 and 5b). — Lanterns and forks stand on a proved resume; this brief supplies that proof.
- Adopting, wrapping or calling Norn's session code; Pi's code is read as the reference and not vendored. — Tom, Dot 13:28: not Norn. Pi's tree is the reference.
- Adopting, wrapping or calling Codex's own importer of Claude Code files. — It is the recorded baseline, a compaction and not a copy; the ruling is to improve on it and not adopt it (ADR-012).
- Launching Codex on a rendered rollout through the launch template. — That is the launch template's next version; the render writes a file and never runs the agent (ADR-007).

## Inventory

- `docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md` — the authority: 'The home', 'The home is portable: lanterns, translation and forks', and steps 4 and 5
- `docs/design/identity/CONTEXT-ROADMAP-2026-09-22.md` — Archie's roadmap; this cluster is its stage 4 and the resume half of stage 3
- `docs/design/identity/briefs/CONTEXT-001.json` — stage 1, byte-for-byte capture and the lys-home crate this cluster extends
- `docs/design/secrets/briefs/SECRETS-002.json` — the door's proxy (R1) that the tee joins once it exists
- `$PI/packages/coding-agent/src/core/session-manager.ts` — Pi's session tree at 3d5cbe98 (github.com/earendil-works/pi): header, entries, leaf (branch at :1125 moves an in-memory cursor; _buildIndex:754 restores the last physical entry on reopen; loadEntriesFromFile:438 reads the whole file)
- `$PI/packages/ai/src/api/transform-messages.ts` — per-provider thinking: same provider, api and model keeps blocks whole; otherwise text, opaque dropped
- `$PI/packages/coding-agent/src/core/branch-summarization.ts` — how an abandoned branch's work is carried into the new one
- `$CCFLARE/README.md` — ccflare at 95c4c6a (github.com/snipeship/ccflare): the concept of a native pass-through that keeps request history; reference only, not used (Tom, Dot 13:34)
- `$LANTERN/docs/02-SESSION-FORMATS.md` — the lantern measurement of session formats: section 3 records Codex's importer of Claude Code files at the June checkout d667082322 (drops thinking, sidechains and meta records; clips tool_use notes at 2,000 and tool_result at 4,000 characters; ends with an in-band imported marker) and the ruling to improve on it
- `crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/render.rs` — the Claude Code render the Codex render walks the same way; mints a random uuid for any entry id that is not uuid-shaped, so its output is byte-stable only for sessions without multi-result tool records

## Constraints

- **CN1** — No file under ~/.claude/projects is rewritten or truncated by this cluster; a render writes a new file under a new uuid only, and refuses an existing path by name.
- **CN2** — A rendered file never carries a provider-native opaque block that came from a different provider or model family than the one it is rendered for; the loss account names each block dropped by hash.
- **CN3** — Transcript contents never appear in output, logs, errors, test names or pages; hashes, counts, offsets and event ids only.
- **CN4** — Every home file parses with Pi's parseSessionEntries at 3d5cbe98 unchanged: the header line first, every entry with id, parentId and timestamp, lys data only inside custom entries.
- **CN5** — The pass-through proxy forwards every header and the streamed body unchanged and stores nothing but the measurement; it is an example binary, never a service.
- **CN6** — No Norn crate is a dependency of lys-home and no Norn type is copied into it.
- **CN7** — Reading the root-to-leaf path of a home file reads only the entries on that path plus the index, never the whole file (Pi loads the whole journal; Chippy 13:33); the head is persisted beside the file, never inferred from the last physical entry on reopen.
- **CN8** — No file under a live Codex home is written, rewritten or truncated by this cluster: a Codex render writes only under the target directory it is given, and the proof runs Codex only with CODEX_HOME set to a scratch directory; no credential or auth.json is copied into that directory.
- **CN9** — lys-home neither depends on nor calls Codex code or Codex's importer, and builds and tests with no Codex installed; only the proof runs a Codex binary.
