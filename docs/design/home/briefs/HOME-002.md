# HOME-002: Launch a Claude Code session from its home through a kept template

> **Cluster:** home
> **Depends on:** HOME-001
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-001 — Secrets are held behind a handle the door swaps for the credential — A seat holds a short-lived handle bound to its identity. The real credential sits in the door's encrypted store and never leaves the server. The door's proxy checks SpiceDB, swaps the handle for the credential, forwards the call and writes one audit line. Built in Rust inside the door; no OpenBao unless credentials minted on demand are later needed.
> - ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
> - ADR-007 — The product starts an agent by giving its start command, never by running it — The product is not an execution engine. For the first release an agent's file gives the command that starts it on a chosen machine: the command carries the agent's identity and its handles, never a credential's value, and it is rendered from the agent's kept launch record. A started agent reports back, so the sessions screen shows what is running. A terminal inside the product, sandboxes, virtual machines and containers are later runtimes that plug in, and none is built into this product.
> - ADR-012 — A harness launch template is kept in the home by hash, and each render is recorded on the session beside its context path — A launch template per harness is a JSON object with named slots (transcript, mcp, env, secrets, instructions) plus flags, stored in the home under templates/ by its SHA-256; lys-home renders a template and a session into files and runtime variables with command mappings in text, prints the launch line and never runs it, and records each render as a sixth lys.harness_event kind, template_render, hung as a side leaf beside the context path with the written paths in a manifest block named by hash. Rejected: a transcript converter or adapter protocol per harness, a template kept outside the home (a seat document of another tool), and a render event that advances the head, which would change the session head hash between two renders of the same session.
> **Checklist:**
> - C14 — A Claude Code launch template schema in docs/design/home names its five slots (transcript, mcp, env, secrets, instructions), and a template with a slot outside them is refused by that slot's name with nothing written.
> - C15 — The home keeps each template it renders as an object under templates/ named by its SHA-256, written once and never rewritten.
> - C16 — lys-home render-launch writes the rendered JSONL, its loss account, an MCP configuration file, an environment file and an appended-instructions file into one directory, and a second render of the same template and session writes files with identical SHA-256.
> - C17 — The launch line in render-launch's report resumes the rendered file by path with --fork-session and the template's flags, and the tool never runs it.
> - C18 — A use-only secret is written as its handle and never its value, and a template marking a secret readable is refused naming secret_reader_unbuilt and SECRETS-002.
> - C19 — Every render appends one lys.harness_event of kind template_render beside the context path, naming the template hash, the session head hash and a manifest block of the written paths, and the head does not move.
> - C20 — PROOF-LAUNCH.md records the launch measured on the installed Claude Code version: template hash, written paths and hashes, launch line, the rendered file unchanged, where the continuation landed; never transcript content.
> **Stories:**
> - S9 (Agent, Runs in a harness and wants to continue somewhere else) — As an agent, I want my session turned into a running Claude Code session from a template kept in my home, so that I start with my own record, tools, environment and instructions rather than a blank harness.
> - S10 (Tom, Owns the platform and reads what a session was given) — As Tom, I want a secret a session may only use to reach it as a handle and never as its value, so that the credential never enters the session's process.
> - S11 (Reviewer, Checks the proofs before anything relies on them) — As the reviewer, I want every launch recorded on the session with the template hash, the session head hash and the written paths, so that I can tell which template a session was launched with.

## Purpose

The home holds the record a new session is made from, but nothing turns it into a running session on a harness. This brief adds the first launch template, for Claude Code: a JSON object kept in the home by its SHA-256, with its schema in docs/design/home, and a lys-home subcommand, render-launch, that reads a template and a session and writes the files a Claude Code launch needs into one directory (the R4-rendered JSONL and its loss account, an MCP configuration file, an environment file, an appended-instructions file), prints one JSON report carrying the launch line, and records the render on the session as a template_render harness event hung beside the context path, so a stranger can tell which template a session was launched with (design solution, ADR-012).

## Task

Build the Claude Code launch template and the render-launch subcommand, in dependency order: the template schema and parser (R1), a deterministic record uuid in the R4 render so a session renders byte-identically twice (R2), the home's template store (R3), a side-leaf append and the session head hash (R4), the template_render event kind (R5), the environment file with handles (R6), the subcommand (R7), the measured launch (R8), and the ruling's record plus the re-rendered cluster markdown (R9).

What the words settle and how this brief reads them. The transcript slot is the one slot no template maps generically: the template names how this harness fills it (`resume-by-path`), and Claude Code fills it by resuming the rendered file by path. The launch line resumes by path WITH --fork-session: PROOF-FEWSHOT.md measured that a bare `claude --resume <path>` writes its continuation beside the passed file as <sessionId>.jsonl, which is the rendered file's own name under R4 (sessionId = the chosen uuid), so a bare resume would write onto the rendered file and break its recorded hash; PROOF-RESUME.md resumed with --fork-session. The rendered file is a launch artefact and is never written to after the render; the continuation lands under ~/.claude/projects for the run's working directory under the uuid Claude Code assigns at the fork, which is where the importer already reads, and that uuid is learned at capture, where the fork's parent link names the rendered session id. The launch line carries the rendered path and the flags only.

Secrets. The words' sentence that the launch line reads the value through the broker at start is corrected here: a secret the template marks use-only is written as its handle and nothing else, and the launch line reads nothing for it, so its value never enters the process (ADR-001). A broker read at start happens only for a secret the template marks readable, and no broker reader exists until SECRETS-002 lands one, so a template naming any readable secret is refused naming secret_reader_unbuilt and SECRETS-002, and only handle-only secrets render. The schema carries the reader as a named command mapping in text (slots.secrets.reader), so SECRETS-002 fills it without a schema change; this brief never substitutes it into a launch line. The broker's own read is out of scope.

The pieces. The subcommand launches the session it is given. The transcript slot may name a canon file, and then the render is taken with that canon exactly as R4's render --canon does (HOME-001 R11). The handover is not carried: HOME-001 R12 (record/handover.rs) is not on main, and a later card adds a handover slot once R12 lands. The first sentence of the words names the record, the canon and the handover as what the home holds, not as what this card launches.

The recorded hashes. The CI acceptance renders a synthetic fixture session committed to the tree, holding no transcript content, and compares the written files against SHA-256 values recorded in the test. The recorded session from PROOF-RESUME is run once on the proof machine (R8): the proof records the template hash, the written paths, their hashes and the resume outcome, never the file or its content, and the private session is never committed (CN3, P7).

The record. The render's lys.harness_event is a side leaf: its parentId is the head, the head does not move, the render walker never sees it, and a second render of the same session records the same session head hash in a second event. The record already has side leaves beside the context path (permission_mode and tool_completed events, RECORD.md), so no new entry kind is added; the new thing is the sixth event kind, template_render, which RECORD.md and the design name. The written paths ride in a manifest block the event names by hash, so the event stays under the 512-byte cap whatever the paths are.

The ruling this stands on is recorded at docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md line 181 in a shorter relayed form; R9 adds the two items the relay omits to that entry, keeping its mark that it stands for correction.

Out of scope: any harness other than Claude Code, launching on another machine, the broker's own read, running the launch line, the handover slot, capture of the launched session into the home.

## Requirements

### R1: Define the Claude Code launch template: its schema and its parser, refusing an unknown slot by name

Structure: docs/design/home/launch-template.schema.json is a JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) for one JSON object with exactly three members, all required: `harness` (the string `claude-code`), `flags` (an array of strings, the extra Claude Code arguments the launch line carries, in order) and `slots` (an object with exactly five members, all required, and additionalProperties false): `transcript` {`fill`: the string `resume-by-path`, `canon`: a canon file path string or null}, `mcp` (an object written verbatim as the MCP configuration file; it carries `mcpServers`), `env` (an object of environment variable name to string value), `secrets` {`use_only`: array of {`env`, `handle`}, `readable`: array of {`env`, `handle`}, `reader`: a string, the broker reader's command mapping in text, empty until the secrets rows fill it}, and `instructions` (a string, the text appended to the system prompt). A parser in crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/template.rs reads that shape. IF a template's `slots` object holds a member not among the five, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse the template with HomeError::UnknownSlot naming that member AND SHALL NOT store the template, open a session or write any file. IF one of the five slots is missing, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse the template with HomeError::MissingSlot naming it. IF `harness` is not `claude-code` or `transcript.fill` is not `resume-by-path`, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse the template naming the field and the value given. IF `secrets.readable` holds any entry, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse the template with HomeError::SecretReaderUnbuilt, whose message names `secret_reader_unbuilt`, `SECRETS-002` and the entry's env name, AND SHALL NOT write, print or invoke the `reader` text. IF two entries across `env`, `secrets.use_only` and `secrets.readable` name the same environment variable, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse the template naming the variable. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT interpret, expand or execute any string in the template, and SHALL NOT put a template's `instructions`, `env` values or `mcp` contents in an error message. The template hash is the SHA-256 of the template file's bytes exactly as read.

**Acceptance:**
- Parsing crates/lys-home/tests/fixtures/launch/template.json returns a template whose flags are ["--strict-mcp-config"], whose transcript fill is `resume-by-path` with canon null, and whose use_only secrets are exactly one entry {env: LYS_FIXTURE_TOKEN, handle: handle-fixture-0001}.
- Parsing the fixture with slots.voice = {} added returns HomeError::UnknownSlot whose Display contains `voice`.
- Parsing the fixture with slots.instructions removed returns HomeError::MissingSlot whose Display contains `instructions`.
- Parsing the fixture with secrets.readable = [{"env": "LYS_FIXTURE_READ", "handle": "handle-fixture-0002"}] returns HomeError::SecretReaderUnbuilt whose Display contains `secret_reader_unbuilt`, `SECRETS-002` and `LYS_FIXTURE_READ`.
- Parsing the fixture with harness set to `codex` returns an error whose Display contains `harness` and `codex`.
- Parsing the fixture with env.LYS_FIXTURE_TOKEN = "x" added returns an error whose Display contains `LYS_FIXTURE_TOKEN`.
- A test reads docs/design/home/launch-template.schema.json and asserts that the property names of its `slots` object are exactly {transcript, mcp, env, secrets, instructions}, the same set the parser accepts, and that `slots` has additionalProperties false.
- The template hash of the fixture equals the SHA-256 of the fixture file's bytes computed by the sha2 crate in the test.

**Files:**
- create: docs/design/home/launch-template.schema.json
- create: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/template.rs
- create: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/template_tests.rs
- create: crates/lys-home/tests/fixtures/launch/template.json
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/mod.rs
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/error.rs

**Checklist:**
- C14 — A Claude Code launch template schema in docs/design/home names its five slots (transcript, mcp, env, secrets, instructions), and a template with a slot outside them is refused by that slot's name with nothing written.

**Stories:**
- S9 (Agent, Runs in a harness and wants to continue somewhere else) — As an agent, I want my session turned into a running Claude Code session from a template kept in my home, so that I start with my own record, tools, environment and instructions rather than a blank harness.

### R2: Make the render's record uuid a function of the entry id, so a session renders byte-identically twice

WHEN render_claude_code maps an entry whose id is not uuid-shaped, THE SYSTEM SHALL derive the record uuid from the SHA-256 of the entry id's bytes, formatted as today's uuid shape (8-4-4-4-12 hex, version nibble 4, variant nibble 8), AND SHALL NOT draw a random value for it. WHILE an entry id is already uuid-shaped, THE SYSTEM SHALL keep it unchanged, as today. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT change any other byte the render writes, the loss account's shape, or the render report's fields.

**Acceptance:**
- Rendering a session of four message entries with ids e1, e2, e3 and e4 twice, to two different paths under the same target uuid, cwd, model and version, yields two files with equal bytes and two loss accounts with equal bytes.
- In that render the four records carry four distinct uuids, and each record after the first has parentUuid equal to the previous record's uuid.
- An entry with id 5f0c0b8e-2a1d-4c3b-9e7f-0123456789ab renders with uuid 5f0c0b8e-2a1d-4c3b-9e7f-0123456789ab.
- The existing render and round-trip tests (render_tests.rs, tests/claude_code_round_trip.rs) pass unchanged.

**Files:**
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/render.rs
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/render_tests.rs

**Checklist:**
- C16 — lys-home render-launch writes the rendered JSONL, its loss account, an MCP configuration file, an environment file and an appended-instructions file into one directory, and a second render of the same template and session writes files with identical SHA-256.

**Stories:**
- S9 (Agent, Runs in a harness and wants to continue somewhere else) — As an agent, I want my session turned into a running Claude Code session from a template kept in my home, so that I start with my own record, tools, environment and instructions rather than a blank harness.

### R3: Keep each template in the home as an object named by its SHA-256

Structure: a home keeps templates under `templates/` beside `sessions/` and `blocks/`, with the block store's layout and write discipline (`templates/<hh>/<hash>`, written to a temporary file, fsynced, renamed, directory fsynced). WHEN a template is stored, THE SYSTEM SHALL name it by the SHA-256 of its bytes, return that hash and whether it was new, AND SHALL NOT write it again when the same bytes are already held. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT rewrite or delete a stored template. Home::open SHALL NOT change: the templates directory is created when the first template is stored.

**Acceptance:**
- Storing the fixture template's bytes into a fresh home returns its SHA-256 with new = true, and the file templates/<first two hex>/<hash> holds bytes equal to the fixture's.
- Storing the same bytes a second time returns the same hash with new = false and leaves the stored file's modification time unchanged.
- Home::open on a fresh directory creates exactly `sessions` and `blocks`, as before.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-home/src/record/templates.rs
- create: crates/lys-home/src/record/templates_tests.rs
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/record/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C15 — The home keeps each template it renders as an object under templates/ named by its SHA-256, written once and never rewritten.

**Stories:**
- S11 (Reviewer, Checks the proofs before anything relies on them) — As the reviewer, I want every launch recorded on the session with the template hash, the session head hash and the written paths, so that I can tell which template a session was launched with.

### R4: Append an entry beside the context path without moving the head, and name the session head by hash

WHEN Session::append_beside is given an entry body, THE SYSTEM SHALL append it with a fresh id, parentId equal to the current head and the current time, durable in the same order as an append (entry line, then index row), AND SHALL NOT write or move the head. append_entry and append_beside SHALL share one durable write path, so a failure after the line is durable reconciles the same way. Structure: the session head hash is the SHA-256 of the head entry's line bytes in the session file, trailing newline included, exactly the bytes its index row's offset and length name; for a session with no head it is the SHA-256 of the header line, trailing newline included. THE SYSTEM SHALL read those bytes by seeking to the row and SHALL NOT read the whole file for it.

**Acceptance:**
- On a session whose head is e4, append_beside of a custom entry returns an id whose entry has parentId e4; afterwards head() is e4, the <id>.head file's bytes are unchanged, and context_path() returns the same four entries as before.
- After reopening that session with Session::open, head() is e4 and customs_everywhere of the appended custom type returns one entry.
- For the fixture session crates/lys-home/tests/fixtures/launch/session.jsonl, the session head hash equals the SHA-256 of that file's last line plus a newline, computed by the test from the fixture bytes.
- The session head hash is equal before and after an append_beside.
- For a session holding only its header line, the session head hash equals the SHA-256 of the header line plus a newline.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-home/src/record/beside.rs
- create: crates/lys-home/src/record/beside_tests.rs
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/record/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C19 — Every render appends one lys.harness_event of kind template_render beside the context path, naming the template hash, the session head hash and a manifest block of the written paths, and the head does not move.

**Stories:**
- S11 (Reviewer, Checks the proofs before anything relies on them) — As the reviewer, I want every launch recorded on the session with the template hash, the session head hash and the written paths, so that I can tell which template a session was launched with.

### R5: Add template_render as the sixth lys.harness_event kind, carrying the written paths by a manifest block

Structure: a sixth event kind, KIND_TEMPLATE_RENDER = `template_render`, whose data is {kind: `template_render`, harness: `claude-code`, source_uuid: null, record: the SHA-256 of a manifest block, detail: {template: the template hash, session_head: the session head hash, files: the count of files written}}. The manifest block is one JSON object stored in the home's block store: {template, session_head, head (the head entry id, or null), uuid (the rendered session id), files: [{path, sha256}] in write order}. WHEN a template_render event is built, THE SYSTEM SHALL apply the existing 512-byte check to its data AND SHALL NOT put a path, a flag, an environment value, a handle or the instructions text in its detail. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT change the five existing kinds, their data, or MAX_DATA_BYTES. RECORD.md SHALL document the sixth kind, the manifest block and that the event hangs beside the context path as a side leaf.

**Acceptance:**
- A template_render event built from a 64-hex template hash, a 64-hex session head hash, a 64-hex manifest hash and files = 5 serialises to data of at most 512 bytes with kind `template_render` and source_uuid null.
- The manifest block for five files whose paths are each 240 bytes long is stored, and the event built from its hash still serialises to at most 512 bytes.
- KIND_HOOK, KIND_PERMISSION_MODE, KIND_TOOL_COMPLETED, KIND_ATTACHMENT and KIND_SYSTEM keep their values and MAX_DATA_BYTES is 512.
- docs/design/home/RECORD.md lists `template_render` among the lys.harness_event kinds and names the manifest block's fields template, session_head, head, uuid and files.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/events_tests.rs
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/events.rs
- modify: docs/design/home/RECORD.md

**Checklist:**
- C19 — Every render appends one lys.harness_event of kind template_render beside the context path, naming the template hash, the session head hash and a manifest block of the written paths, and the head does not move.

**Stories:**
- S11 (Reviewer, Checks the proofs before anything relies on them) — As the reviewer, I want every launch recorded on the session with the template hash, the session head hash and the written paths, so that I can tell which template a session was launched with.

### R6: Write the environment file: the template's variables and each use-only secret as its handle

WHEN the environment file is written from a parsed template, THE SYSTEM SHALL write a Claude Code settings file whose only member is `env`, an object holding each `slots.env` name with its value and each `slots.secrets.use_only` env name with its handle, AND SHALL NOT read any secret's value, SHALL NOT read the process environment to fill any entry, and SHALL NOT write a `readable` secret (R1 refuses it before this point). The file is serialised with keys in sorted order, so the same template writes the same bytes.

**Acceptance:**
- From the fixture template the environment file parses as {"env": {"LYS_FIXTURE_MODE": "fixture", "LYS_FIXTURE_TOKEN": "handle-fixture-0001"}} and holds no other member.
- Written while the process environment holds LYS_FIXTURE_TOKEN=fixture-secret-value-0001, the environment file holds 0 occurrences of the bytes fixture-secret-value-0001.
- Writing the environment file twice from the fixture template gives equal bytes.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/launch_env.rs

**Checklist:**
- C18 — A use-only secret is written as its handle and never its value, and a template marking a secret readable is refused naming secret_reader_unbuilt and SECRETS-002.

**Stories:**
- S10 (Tom, Owns the platform and reads what a session was given) — As Tom, I want a secret a session may only use to reach it as a handle and never as its value, so that the credential never enters the session's process.

### R7: Add `lys-home render-launch`: write the launch files, print the report and the launch line, record the render

Add a subcommand `render-launch --home <dir> --session <id> --template <file> --uuid <uuid> --cwd <dir> --model <id> --version <claude code version> --out <dir>`; its arguments and logic live in crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/launch.rs and cli.rs holds only the variant and its dispatch. WHEN run, THE SYSTEM SHALL, in this order: parse the template (R1); open the home and the session, taking its lock; refuse by path any of the five target files that already exists; store the template (R3); take the session head hash (R4); render the session with R4's render to <out>/<uuid>.jsonl with its loss account <out>/<uuid>.loss.json, taking the canon named by slots.transcript.canon when it is not null; write <out>/mcp.json (the mcp slot verbatim, keys sorted), <out>/env.json (R6) and <out>/instructions.md (the instructions slot's bytes); hash the five files; store the manifest block and append one template_render event with append_beside (R4, R5); and print one JSON report {command, template, session_head, uuid, files: [{path, sha256}], launch, event, manifest, render}. The launch member SHALL be one line: `claude --resume <out>/<uuid>.jsonl --fork-session --mcp-config <out>/mcp.json --settings <out>/env.json --append-system-prompt-file <out>/instructions.md` followed by the template's flags in order, arguments separated by one space, an argument holding a character outside letters, digits and `._/=:-` single-quoted for a POSIX shell. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT run the launch line or any process (ADR-007), SHALL NOT print transcript, block, body, instructions, environment values or MCP contents, SHALL NOT write outside <out> and the home, and SHALL NOT write any file after a refusal. IF a required argument is missing, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL exit 2 naming it (clap). IF the template is refused, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL exit 1 with the refusal's message on stderr and write nothing. IF the event cannot be recorded, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL exit 1 naming the failure and SHALL NOT print a report.

**Acceptance:**
- `lys-home render-launch` given every argument but --template exits 2 and its stderr contains `--template`.
- Given a fresh home holding the fixture session (session.jsonl, id `fixture`), the fixture template, --uuid 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001, --cwd /fixture, --model claude-fixture, --version 2.1.283 and an empty --out, the command exits 0 and <out> holds exactly five files: 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001.jsonl, 00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001.loss.json, mcp.json, env.json and instructions.md.
- The SHA-256 of each of those five files equals the value recorded for it as a constant in tests/launch_template.rs.
- Running it a second time with a second empty --out gives five files whose SHA-256 values equal the first run's pairwise, and a report whose session_head equals the first report's.
- The report's launch member equals `claude --resume <out>/00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001.jsonl --fork-session --mcp-config <out>/mcp.json --settings <out>/env.json --append-system-prompt-file <out>/instructions.md --strict-mcp-config` with <out> the given directory, and the test observes no child process (the command's only output is its stdout report).
- With LYS_FIXTURE_TOKEN=fixture-secret-value-0001 in the command's environment, a byte search of the five written files and of stdout for fixture-secret-value-0001 finds 0 matches, and env.json's env.LYS_FIXTURE_TOKEN is handle-fixture-0001.
- The report parses as JSON and contains no key named text, no key named content and no key named body, at any depth.
- After the two runs, the session reopens with head `e4`, customs_everywhere("lys.harness_event") returns two entries whose parentId is e4 and whose data.kind is template_render, and each event's data.detail.template equals the SHA-256 of the fixture template file.
- The template object templates/<hh>/<hash> in the home exists with the hash the report names as template.
- Run with the fixture template plus slots.voice = {}, the command exits 1, stderr contains `voice`, <out> holds 0 files, the home holds no templates directory, and the session file's bytes are unchanged.
- Run with the fixture template plus one readable secret, the command exits 1, stderr contains `secret_reader_unbuilt` and `SECRETS-002`, and <out> holds 0 files.
- Run with --out naming a directory that already holds env.json, the command exits 1, stderr names that env.json path, and the directory holds only env.json with its bytes unchanged.

**Files:**

- create: crates/lys-home/tests/launch_template.rs
- create: crates/lys-home/tests/fixtures/launch/session.jsonl
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/cli.rs
- modify: crates/lys-home/README.md

**Checklist:**
- C14 — A Claude Code launch template schema in docs/design/home names its five slots (transcript, mcp, env, secrets, instructions), and a template with a slot outside them is refused by that slot's name with nothing written.
- C16 — lys-home render-launch writes the rendered JSONL, its loss account, an MCP configuration file, an environment file and an appended-instructions file into one directory, and a second render of the same template and session writes files with identical SHA-256.
- C17 — The launch line in render-launch's report resumes the rendered file by path with --fork-session and the template's flags, and the tool never runs it.
- C18 — A use-only secret is written as its handle and never its value, and a template marking a secret readable is refused naming secret_reader_unbuilt and SECRETS-002.
- C19 — Every render appends one lys.harness_event of kind template_render beside the context path, naming the template hash, the session head hash and a manifest block of the written paths, and the head does not move.

**Stories:**
- S9 (Agent, Runs in a harness and wants to continue somewhere else) — As an agent, I want my session turned into a running Claude Code session from a template kept in my home, so that I start with my own record, tools, environment and instructions rather than a blank harness.

- S11 (Reviewer, Checks the proofs before anything relies on them) — As the reviewer, I want every launch recorded on the session with the template hash, the session head hash and the written paths, so that I can tell which template a session was launched with.

### R8: Measure the launch on the installed Claude Code and write it down

WHEN the launch is proved, THE SYSTEM's proof SHALL import the recorded session from PROOF-RESUME into a home, run render-launch on it with a proof template, and run the printed launch line once, from a working directory that is neither the out directory nor the session's cwd, on the Claude Code version `claude --version` reports on the proof machine; docs/design/home/PROOF-LAUNCH.md SHALL record that version, the proof template's hash, the written paths relative to the out directory with their SHA-256, the launch line with the out directory written as <out>, the rendered file's SHA-256 before and after the launch, where the continuation was written relative to ~/.claude/projects, whether the continuation's parent link names the rendered session id, the resume-check report, whether the appended instructions took effect under the proof template's --system-prompt-snapshot setting, whether a tool call in the launched session saw the environment file's handle, and whether --mcp-config was accepted. The proof SHALL NOT contain the session file, any transcript, block or body content, or a secret value, and the private session SHALL NOT be committed. The Claude Code profile's module doc in harness/claude_code/mod.rs SHALL state that a launch resumes with --fork-session because a bare resume writes onto <sessionId>.jsonl beside the passed file, with the version it was measured on.

**Acceptance:**
- docs/design/home/PROOF-LAUNCH.md names the Claude Code version string printed by `claude --version` on the proof run.
- PROOF-LAUNCH.md records the rendered file's SHA-256 before and after the launch, and the two are equal.
- PROOF-LAUNCH.md records the continuation's path relative to ~/.claude/projects, in the run directory's slug directory, and the path is not the rendered file's path.
- PROOF-LAUNCH.md records the resume-check report with repeated_tool_use_ids equal to 0.
- PROOF-LAUNCH.md records, for each of four questions, one answer from {yes, no} with the observation it rests on: the parent link naming the rendered session id, the appended instructions taking effect, the handle being visible to a tool call, and --mcp-config being accepted.
- A search of PROOF-LAUNCH.md for the text of any message of the proof session finds nothing: it holds hashes, paths, counts, flags and answers from {yes, no} only.
- git ls-files lists no .jsonl file outside crates/lys-home/tests/fixtures and canon/.

**Files:**
- create: docs/design/home/PROOF-LAUNCH.md
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C17 — The launch line in render-launch's report resumes the rendered file by path with --fork-session and the template's flags, and the tool never runs it.
- C20 — PROOF-LAUNCH.md records the launch measured on the installed Claude Code version: template hash, written paths and hashes, launch line, the rendered file unchanged, where the continuation landed; never transcript content.

**Stories:**
- S9 (Agent, Runs in a harness and wants to continue somewhere else) — As an agent, I want my session turned into a running Claude Code session from a template kept in my home, so that I start with my own record, tools, environment and instructions rather than a blank harness.

### R9: Record the whole ruling in the tree and re-render the cluster's markdown

Structure: the entry for steps 4 and 5 in the identity cluster's statement document named in this requirement's files (at line 181, the relayed rules for the home) gains the two items the relay omits, in the relayed register: the mapping also covers where the prior conversation goes, and it is delivered as files and runtime variables, with command mappings in text and never a transcript converter. The entry keeps its existing mark that it stands as relayed, for correction, and no other line of that document changes. docs/design/home/DESIGN.md, CHECKLIST.md, USER-STORIES.md and briefs/HOME-002.md are re-rendered by the method's render-cluster.py from their JSON and are never edited by hand.

**Acceptance:**
- `git diff` of the identity statement document named in this requirement's files touches only the steps 4 and 5 entry, and that entry contains `where the prior conversation goes`, `runtime variables`, `in text` and `never a transcript converter` and the entry's first sentence, which marks it as relayed for correction, is byte-identical before and after.
- `sh scripts/design/gate.sh` exits 0 from the repository root.

**Files:**
- create: docs/design/home/briefs/HOME-002.md
- modify: docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md
- modify: docs/design/home/DESIGN.md
- modify: docs/design/home/CHECKLIST.md
- modify: docs/design/home/USER-STORIES.md

**Checklist:**
- C20 — PROOF-LAUNCH.md records the launch measured on the installed Claude Code version: template hash, written paths and hashes, launch line, the rendered file unchanged, where the continuation landed; never transcript content.

## Boundaries

- SHALL NOT run the launch line, spawn Claude Code or any other process; the line is printed in the report (ADR-007).
- SHALL NOT write a secret's value to any file, report, launch line, error or entry; a use-only secret appears only as its handle, and a readable secret is refused until SECRETS-002 builds the reader.
- SHALL NOT build, call or name a broker reader command in a launch line; the broker's own read belongs to the secrets rows.
- SHALL NOT add a harness other than Claude Code, a launch on another machine, a sandbox or VM target profile, or capture of the launched session into the home.
- SHALL NOT add a handover slot; HOME-001 R12 is not on main.
- SHALL NOT rewrite, truncate or write into any file under ~/.claude/projects, and SHALL NOT write to the rendered file after the render (CN1).
- SHALL NOT move the session head when recording a render; the event is a side leaf.
- SHALL NOT change the five existing lys.harness_event kinds, MAX_DATA_BYTES, Pi's grammar, or the reports of import, render, fewshot, ingest-call and resume-check.
- SHALL NOT commit the PROOF-RESUME session or any real transcript; the CI fixture is synthetic (CN3, P7).
- SHALL NOT add a dependency on manifold, the door, aion or any Norn crate (ADR-004, CN6).

## Verification

- From docs/: python3 $DS2_METHOD/scripts/validate.py design/home exits 0.
- From docs/: python3 $DS2_METHOD/scripts/check-coverage.py design/home exits 0.
- From the repository root: sh scripts/design/gate.sh exits 0.
- From the repository root: cargo fmt --all -- --check, cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings, cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings, cargo test --workspace --all-features, cargo doc --no-deps --all-features and cargo doc --no-deps exit 0.
- cargo test -p lys-home --test launch_template reports every test in the file run and passed, with a non-zero count.
- grep -rn 'Command::new\|process::Command' crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/launch.rs crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/launch_env.rs crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/template.rs finds nothing.
- Every file under crates/lys-home/src is at most 500 lines of code excluding comments and blank lines, and cli.rs gains only the render-launch variant and its dispatch.
