# HOME-003: Record what a session was given: a lys.given entry at render, listed and checked by hash

> **Cluster:** home
> **Depends on:** HOME-001, HOME-002
> **Blocked by:** The launch template card ct98Wv-2 (HOME-002: the render-launch subcommand, its template_render event, and the appended instructions file and MCP configuration it writes) is on card/home-002-launch-template (lys PR 14) and not yet on lys main; this brief is built on that branch, lands after it, and hooks into the render step that card places in crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/launch.rs (render_launch), the file the design's structure names for it.
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-001 — Secrets are held behind a handle the door swaps for the credential — A seat holds a short-lived handle bound to its identity. The real credential sits in the door's encrypted store and never leaves the server. The door's proxy checks SpiceDB, swaps the handle for the credential, forwards the call and writes one audit line. Built in Rust inside the door; no OpenBao unless credentials minted on demand are later needed.
> - ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
> - ADR-007 — The product starts an agent by giving its start command, never by running it — The product is not an execution engine. For the first release an agent's file gives the command that starts it on a chosen machine: the command carries the agent's identity and its handles, never a credential's value, and it is rendered from the agent's kept launch record. A started agent reports back, so the sessions screen shows what is running. A terminal inside the product, sandboxes, virtual machines and containers are later runtimes that plug in, and none is built into this product.
> - ADR-013 — The context record is a lys.given custom entry of document hashes, never copies — The context record is one lys.given custom entry, appended after the render event, whose data is the harness name, the Claude Code version the load order was measured on, the kinds as two lists, resolved (claude_md_chain, user_claude_md, memory_index, appended_instructions, mcp_config, environment_names) and unlisted (claude_md_imports and claude_rules, which this entry does not list and a later entry at the first request records), the config directory as its path and its source (template or home), the documents in the measured order each as kind, path, byte length and SHA-256, and the names of the environment variables the template set. It is not a copy of each document into the block store, and not a content-bearing record, because the entry must hold no content under home P7 and CN3. It is unsigned and unencrypted now, and because it names hashes only, signing and encryption at rest can be added later without changing what is recorded.
> **Checklist:**
> - C21 — Every launch-template render appends one lys.given custom entry after the render event, listing the instruction documents Claude Code will load for the session's working directory and the files the render wrote, in the order measured on the named Claude Code version, each by kind, path, byte length and SHA-256, with the harness name and version, the kinds resolved, the kinds it leaves unlisted, and the environment variable names the template set; never a document's content and never a variable's value.
> - C22 — lys-home lists a session's given records with their documents, and checks a listed document against a file on disk by hash, answering matches or differs and never printing either file.
> - C23 — The Claude Code version on this Mac, the instruction load order and project slug rule measured from its own behaviour, and one real session render, are written in PROOF-GIVEN.md as paths, counts and hashes only.
> **Stories:**
> - S12 (Tom, Owns the platform and reads what a session was given) — As Tom, I want every render to record which instruction documents the session was given, in the order the harness reads them, by path, length and hash, with the environment names it was set, so that I can later check a file on disk against what a session was given without anyone reading its contents.
> - S13 (Reviewer, Checks the proofs before anything relies on them) — As the reviewer, I want the instruction load order measured on a named Claude Code version and written in a proof document, so that a later version that changes the order is caught rather than assumed.

## Purpose

Today a render records the template hash, the session head hash and the written paths, and nothing records which instruction documents the rendered session was given, in what versions or order. This brief makes that record at render, the product's own act (ADR-007): one lys.given custom entry after the render event naming each document Claude Code will load, and each file the render wrote, by path, byte length and SHA-256 in the order measured on a named Claude Code version, with the config directory and how it was found, the environment variable names the template set, and the kinds it resolved and left unlisted, and never a document's content. It is the context record of step 4 in the home design, unsigned and unencrypted, shaped as hashes only so that signing (stage 6) and encryption at rest (stage 3) can be added later without changing what is recorded (ADR-012).

## Task

Build on lys main after ct98Wv-2 lands; start from its template subcommand and its render event. The load order below was measured, not assumed, on the Claude Code installed on the machine this brief was written on: `claude --version` answered 2.1.283. Three runs of `claude -p` were pointed at a local listener, with a fixture config directory (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR), fixture CLAUDE.md files, a memory index, `--append-system-prompt-file` and `--mcp-config`. Each file's first access time gave the order the harness reads the files, and the request it sent gave the order it places them in the context. Across kinds, the order was the same in all three runs: (1) the user CLAUDE.md at <config>/CLAUDE.md; (2) the appended instructions file; (3) the MCP configuration; (4) the CLAUDE.md chain, directory by directory from the outermost ancestor of the working directory down to the working directory itself, each directory contributing its CLAUDE.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md when present; (5) the memory index at <config>/projects/<slug>/memory/MEMORY.md. The project slug is the working directory with every character that is not an ASCII letter or digit replaced by '-': '/', '.' and '_' each became '-', '-' stayed, and a memory directory named under the old '/'-only rule was never read. Within one directory, the read order of CLAUDE.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md changed from run to run (the harness reads them concurrently), while the request always gave them as CLAUDE.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md, CLAUDE.local.md. The entry records the order the request gave, because it holds what reached the model and not the order the harness happened to read the files in: within one directory, CLAUDE.md, then .claude/CLAUDE.md, then CLAUDE.local.md. The config directory is the CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR the template sets for the session; when the template sets none, it is HOME/.claude with HOME taken from the rendering process's environment (the root home P6 measured), and the entry's config_dir member records the path and which of the two it came from (source template or home). The rendering process's own CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR is never read, since that process's environment is not the session's; a launch from another shell or machine is the launch template's to settle, by setting the variable. When the config directory is HOME/.claude and the working directory is under HOME, the file HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md is both the user CLAUDE.md and the .claude/CLAUDE.md position of HOME on the chain. This was measured on 2.1.283 with HOME set to a fixture directory H, no CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, H/.claude/CLAUDE.md and H/w/CLAUDE.md present and the working directory H/w: the request gave H/.claude/CLAUDE.md exactly once, first, as the user's global instructions, and then H/w/CLAUDE.md. The entry lists it the same way: once, as user_claude_md, first, and not again in the chain. When the template sets CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR to another directory, HOME/.claude/CLAUDE.md is not the user file and is listed as claude_md_chain at HOME's place on the chain. A document position the harness would read but finds absent is omitted from the documents list; the kinds member still names every kind this render resolved, so a reader sees what was looked for. The record is limited to the six kinds the card names (claude_md_chain, user_claude_md, memory_index, appended_instructions, mcp_config, environment_names), and the entry says so through its kinds member, which names those six as resolved and names claude_md_imports and claude_rules as unlisted, so a reader can tell those two are missing from this entry rather than absent from the session. Settings, hook output, plugin skills and agents, and output styles are later cards on this same entry shape. A document the render wrote (the appended instructions and the MCP configuration) is named by its kind and its path relative to the render's out directory. Every other document is named by its absolute path. Two renders of a template that writes no per-render bytes therefore give equal document lists. A template that writes a session id into a rendered file gives a differing hash for that one document, and the record shows it. cli.rs has 398 code lines against the 500-line limit, so the two new subcommands live in src/cli/given.rs, declared from cli.rs, and cli.rs keeps only the enum arms that call them. The render wiring goes into the template subcommand's render arm in cli.rs; if ct98Wv-2 places its render step in another file, the scout names that file and the design's structure gains it before the wiring is written. projects_slug moves out of harness/claude_code/mod.rs into paths.rs and is re-exported, so mod.rs holds declarations and re-exports only. render.rs keeps calling projects_slug and needs no edit. In scope: the slug fix, the resolution, the entry, the render wiring, the two subcommands, the fixture tests, RECORD.md and the crate README, and PROOF-GIVEN.md with one real render. Out of scope: signing or anchoring the record (stage 6); encryption at rest (stage 3); documents a session reads later with its own tools; files the harness puts in the request through an @-import or from .claude/rules. The entry made at render records what the render placed and what the harness reads by its documented rule, the three files per directory, and never parses a document to find an import. What actually reached the model, imports and rules included, is recorded by a second lys.given entry appended at the first request by the HOME-001 proxy's capture, from the request as the harness resolved it; that entry belongs to the capture's card, a later unit on this same entry shape, and not to this brief; harnesses other than Claude Code; any change to the render event ct98Wv-2 writes. given-check answers as diff does, so it can stand in a script: exit status 0 when the answer is matches, 1 when it is differs, and 2 on an error such as a missing argument or an unreadable record. Differs is an answer, not an error, and the status tells the two apart; the printed answer is the same either way. The fixture template the acceptance renders is ct98Wv-2's. If that card lands none, the integration test writes one in its own temporary directory, in that card's template format, that writes the appended instructions and MCP configuration with no per-render bytes. The fixture working directory is a fresh temporary directory whose ancestors hold no CLAUDE.md. If the machine running the test has one on the chain, the test's expected list is wrong for that machine, and the scout says so; the resolver is not bent to hide it.

## Requirements

### R1: Resolve the project slug as Claude Code 2.1.283 does

Move projects_slug from harness/claude_code/mod.rs into harness/claude_code/paths.rs, re-exported from mod.rs so every caller keeps its path. WHEN given a working directory, THE SYSTEM SHALL return it with every character that is not an ASCII letter or ASCII digit replaced by '-', and SHALL keep ASCII letters, digits and '-' as they are. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT keep '.' or '_' in a slug, SHALL NOT collapse consecutive '-', and SHALL NOT read or write any file to compute a slug. mod.rs SHALL hold only module declarations, re-exports, constants it already holds, and module docs.

**Acceptance:**
- projects_slug("/home/u/.aion/clones/w") returns "-home-u--aion-clones-w".
- projects_slug("/tmp/x_y/p-q.r/w") returns "-tmp-x-y-p-q-r-w".
- projects_slug("/srv/plain") returns "-srv-plain", unchanged from the rule before this brief.
- harness/claude_code/mod.rs contains no `fn` item after the change.
- The claude_code render tests that passed before the change pass unchanged.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/paths.rs
- create: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/paths_tests.rs
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C23 — The Claude Code version on this Mac, the instruction load order and project slug rule measured from its own behaviour, and one real session render, are written in PROOF-GIVEN.md as paths, counts and hashes only.

**Stories:**
- S13 (Reviewer, Checks the proofs before anything relies on them) — As the reviewer, I want the instruction load order measured on a named Claude Code version and written in a proof document, so that a later version that changes the order is caught rather than assumed.

### R2: Resolve the documents a Claude Code session will be given, in the measured order

WHEN a render resolves the given documents for a working directory, a config directory and the files the render wrote, THE SYSTEM SHALL return one document per file that exists, in this order: the user CLAUDE.md at <config>/CLAUDE.md (kind user_claude_md); the appended instructions file the render wrote (kind appended_instructions); the MCP configuration the render wrote (kind mcp_config); for each directory from the outermost ancestor of the working directory down to the working directory, its CLAUDE.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.local.md (kind claude_md_chain); then the memory index at <config>/projects/<projects_slug(cwd)>/memory/MEMORY.md (kind memory_index). Each document SHALL carry its kind, its path, its byte length and the lowercase hex SHA-256 of its bytes, all taken from one read of the file. A document the render wrote SHALL carry its path relative to the render's out directory; every other document SHALL carry its absolute path. IF a position's file does not exist, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL omit it. IF a file exists and cannot be read, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL fail by name with the path and the operation, and SHALL NOT omit it, since a document the harness would read is being dropped. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT keep, return, log or put in an error any byte of a document's content. It SHALL NOT write any file under the config directory or the working directory. It SHALL NOT parse any document's content, and so SHALL NOT find an @-imported file or a .claude/rules file by reading a document. One directory's files SHALL be listed together, as CLAUDE.md, then .claude/CLAUDE.md, then CLAUDE.local.md, the order the harness's request gives them in; it SHALL NOT list them in the order the files happen to be read. The config directory SHALL be the CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR the template sets for the session. IF the template sets none, THEN the config directory SHALL be HOME/.claude, with HOME taken from the rendering process's environment, and the resolution SHALL return the config directory's path with its source: template in the first case, home in the second. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT read the rendering process's CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR. IF <config>/CLAUDE.md is also a position on the chain (the config directory is D/.claude for a directory D from the outermost ancestor down to the working directory), THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL list that file once, as user_claude_md in the first position, as the harness's request gives it, and SHALL NOT list it again as claude_md_chain. IF the config directory is not D/.claude, THEN D/.claude/CLAUDE.md SHALL be listed as claude_md_chain at D's place on the chain. The measured harness version SHALL be a constant (2.1.283 as measured when this brief was written; R8 re-measures it), named beside the order in the module docs.

**Acceptance:**
- For a temporary working directory W holding CLAUDE.md, a config directory C holding projects/<projects_slug(W)>/memory/MEMORY.md and no CLAUDE.md, and an out directory O holding the render's appended instructions file and MCP configuration, the resolved kinds are, in order: appended_instructions, mcp_config, claude_md_chain, memory_index.
- In that case the appended_instructions and mcp_config documents carry paths relative to O, and the claude_md_chain and memory_index documents carry absolute paths equal to W/CLAUDE.md and the MEMORY.md path under C.
- Each resolved document's length equals the file's byte length, and its sha256 equals the SHA-256 of the file's bytes, as computed independently in the test with the sha2 crate.
- Adding C/CLAUDE.md puts one user_claude_md document first, ahead of appended_instructions.
- For W = A/w with A/CLAUDE.md and W/CLAUDE.md both present, A/CLAUDE.md is listed before W/CLAUDE.md.
- For W holding CLAUDE.local.md, .claude/CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE.md, each created in that order, the resolved claude_md_chain documents are exactly W/CLAUDE.md, W/.claude/CLAUDE.md and W/CLAUDE.local.md, in that order.
- With no MEMORY.md under C, the result holds no memory_index document and the call succeeds.
- With the template setting CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR to C, the memory index under C is listed and the config directory is returned as C with source template. With the template setting none, HOME set to H and the rendering process's CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR set to C, the memory index under H/.claude is listed, none under C is listed, and the config directory is returned as H/.claude with source home.
- With the template setting no CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, HOME set to H, W = H/w, and H/.claude/CLAUDE.md and W/CLAUDE.md both present, the resolved documents are exactly two, in order: H/.claude/CLAUDE.md with kind user_claude_md, then W/CLAUDE.md with kind claude_md_chain; no claude_md_chain document has the path H/.claude/CLAUDE.md.
- With the template setting CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR to C (holding no CLAUDE.md), HOME set to H, W = H/w, and H/.claude/CLAUDE.md and W/CLAUDE.md both present, the resolved documents are exactly two, in order: H/.claude/CLAUDE.md with kind claude_md_chain, then W/CLAUDE.md with kind claude_md_chain; no document has the kind user_claude_md.
- A MEMORY.md placed under projects/<W with only '/' replaced by '-'>/memory/ for a W containing a '.' is not listed.
- A W/CLAUDE.md with its read permission removed fails the resolution with an error naming W/CLAUDE.md, and the error text holds no line of the file.
- The config directory's and the working directory's file listings (names, lengths and modification times) are identical before and after resolution.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/given.rs
- create: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/given_tests.rs
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C21 — Every launch-template render appends one lys.given custom entry after the render event, listing the instruction documents Claude Code will load for the session's working directory and the files the render wrote, in the order measured on the named Claude Code version, each by kind, path, byte length and SHA-256, with the harness name and version, the kinds resolved, the kinds it leaves unlisted, and the environment variable names the template set; never a document's content and never a variable's value.

**Stories:**
- S12 (Tom, Owns the platform and reads what a session was given) — As Tom, I want every render to record which instruction documents the session was given, in the order the harness reads them, by path, length and hash, with the environment names it was set, so that I can later check a file on disk against what a session was given without anyone reading its contents.
- S13 (Reviewer, Checks the proofs before anything relies on them) — As the reviewer, I want the instruction load order measured on a named Claude Code version and written in a proof document, so that a later version that changes the order is caught rather than assumed.

### R3: Define the lys.given entry and append and read it inside Pi's custom entry

Add the custom type constant lys.given beside the four lys custom types. Its data SHALL be exactly: harness ("claude-code"), harness_version (the measured version), kinds (an object with two members: resolved, the list claude_md_chain, user_claude_md, memory_index, appended_instructions, mcp_config, environment_names, in that order; and unlisted, the list claude_md_imports, claude_rules, in that order), config_dir (an object with two members: path, the config directory R2 resolved, and source, template or home as R2 returned it), documents (the ordered list from R2, each {kind, path, length, sha256}) and environment (the names of the environment variables the template set for the session, sorted, since the template's env slot is parsed into a sorted map and the environment file writes it sorted). WHEN a given record is appended, THE SYSTEM SHALL write it with Session::append as a custom entry whose customType is lys.given, so its parentId is the head at that moment. It SHALL read given records back with customs_everywhere("lys.given") in file order. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT add a field to Pi's header or to any entry outside custom.data. It SHALL NOT carry any document content or any environment variable value. It SHALL NOT sign or encrypt the entry. It SHALL NOT record a variable name the template did not set. It SHALL NOT list a document under claude_md_imports or claude_rules, and SHALL NOT drop either name from unlisted.

**Acceptance:**
- A given record appended to a session and read back with customs_everywhere("lys.given") deserialises equal to the value appended.
- The serialised data object of a lys.given entry has exactly the keys config_dir, documents, environment, harness, harness_version and kinds, config_dir has exactly the keys path and source,, and each document object has exactly the keys kind, length, path and sha256.
- A given record built from a resolution whose config directory came from the template has config_dir.source equal to template, and one built from a resolution that fell back to HOME has config_dir.source equal to home and config_dir.path equal to HOME/.claude.
- kinds in every lys.given entry equals {"resolved": ["claude_md_chain", "user_claude_md", "memory_index", "appended_instructions", "mcp_config", "environment_names"], "unlisted": ["claude_md_imports", "claude_rules"]}, and no document in the entry has the kind claude_md_imports or claude_rules.
- Given a template environment of FOO_A=secret-value-1 and BAR_B=secret-value-2, environment equals ["BAR_B", "FOO_A"], sorted, and the serialised entry contains neither secret-value-1 nor secret-value-2.
- The entry's line in the session file has the top-level keys type, id, parentId, timestamp, customType and data, and no other.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-home/src/record/given.rs
- create: crates/lys-home/src/record/given_tests.rs
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/record/entries.rs
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/record/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C21 — Every launch-template render appends one lys.given custom entry after the render event, listing the instruction documents Claude Code will load for the session's working directory and the files the render wrote, in the order measured on the named Claude Code version, each by kind, path, byte length and SHA-256, with the harness name and version, the kinds resolved, the kinds it leaves unlisted, and the environment variable names the template set; never a document's content and never a variable's value.

**Stories:**
- S12 (Tom, Owns the platform and reads what a session was given) — As Tom, I want every render to record which instruction documents the session was given, in the order the harness reads them, by path, length and hash, with the environment names it was set, so that I can later check a file on disk against what a session was given without anyone reading its contents.

### R4: Append the given record after the render event on every template render

WHEN the template subcommand renders a Claude Code session and has appended its render event, THE SYSTEM SHALL resolve the given documents (R2) for the rendered session's working directory, config directory and out directory, and append exactly one lys.given entry (R3) as the child of that render event. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT alter, reorder or re-serialise the render event. IF resolution fails, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL fail the render by name, and SHALL NOT append a lys.given entry holding a partial documents list. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT run the rendered command (ADR-007).

**Acceptance:**
- After one render of the fixture template, the session holds exactly one lys.given entry, and its parentId equals the id of the render event that render appended.
- The tests ct98Wv-2 lands for its render event pass unchanged with this brief's code in the render path.
- A render whose working directory holds an unreadable CLAUDE.md exits non-zero, names the path, and leaves the session with no lys.given entry for that render.

**Files:**
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/launch.rs

**Checklist:**
- C21 — Every launch-template render appends one lys.given custom entry after the render event, listing the instruction documents Claude Code will load for the session's working directory and the files the render wrote, in the order measured on the named Claude Code version, each by kind, path, byte length and SHA-256, with the harness name and version, the kinds resolved, the kinds it leaves unlisted, and the environment variable names the template set; never a document's content and never a variable's value.

**Stories:**
- S12 (Tom, Owns the platform and reads what a session was given) — As Tom, I want every render to record which instruction documents the session was given, in the order the harness reads them, by path, length and hash, with the environment names it was set, so that I can later check a file on disk against what a session was given without anyone reading its contents.

### R5: List a session's given records and check a listed document against a file by hash

Add the subcommands given and given-check, implemented in src/cli/given.rs and dispatched from cli.rs. WHEN given is run on a session, THE SYSTEM SHALL report every lys.given entry in file order with its entry id, harness, harness_version, the config directory with its source, the kinds line naming the resolved kinds and the unlisted kinds, the environment names, and each document's kind, path, length and sha256. WHEN given-check is run with a session, a given entry id, a document path as listed, and a file on disk, THE SYSTEM SHALL hash the file and report the answer matches when its SHA-256 and length equal the listed document's, and differs otherwise. WHEN the answer is matches, THE SYSTEM SHALL exit with status 0; WHEN the answer is differs, THE SYSTEM SHALL exit with status 1. IF an argument is missing, the session or the file cannot be read, or the entry id or the listed path is not in the session, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL fail by name with the id, the path or the argument concerned and exit with status 2. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT exit 0 on differs, SHALL NOT exit 1 on an error, and SHALL NOT print a different answer for either status. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT print, log or put in an error any byte of either file.

**Acceptance:**
- given on a session holding two lys.given entries reports two records in file order, each with its entry id and its full documents list.
- given's report for a record carries a kinds line naming the six resolved kinds and naming claude_md_imports and claude_rules as unlisted, the config directory's path and source equal to the entry's config_dir, and environment equal to the entry's names.
- given-check with the fixture CLAUDE.md as recorded reports the answer matches and exits with status 0.
- given-check with that CLAUDE.md after one byte is changed reports the answer differs and exits with status 1.
- given-check naming an entry id not in the session exits with status 2 and an error naming that id.
- given-check naming a document path not listed in the entry exits with status 2 and an error naming that path.
- given-check run with no file argument exits with status 2.
- given-check naming a file on disk that does not exist exits with status 2 and an error naming that file's path.
- cli.rs has at most 500 code lines, excluding comments and blank lines, after the change.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-home/src/cli/given.rs
- modify: crates/lys-home/src/cli.rs

**Checklist:**
- C22 — lys-home lists a session's given records with their documents, and checks a listed document against a file on disk by hash, answering matches or differs and never printing either file.

**Stories:**
- S12 (Tom, Owns the platform and reads what a session was given) — As Tom, I want every render to record which instruction documents the session was given, in the order the harness reads them, by path, length and hash, with the environment names it was set, so that I can later check a file on disk against what a session was given without anyone reading its contents.

### R6: Prove the acceptance end to end on the fixture template

Add an integration test that renders the fixture template for a fixture working directory holding a CLAUDE.md with a fixed fixture sentence and a memory index under the fixture config directory, then checks every clause of the card's acceptance. The fixture template SHALL set CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR to the fixture config directory C for the rendered session; if ct98Wv-2's fixture template sets none, the test writes its own as the task describes, setting it. The test SHALL run the render with HOME set to a fresh temporary directory holding no .claude directory and with CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR removed from the rendering process's environment, so the resolved documents cannot depend on the configuration of the machine running the test. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT use a fixture sentence as, or inside, a test name. Tests SHALL count what fired: each assertion over a documents list first asserts the list's length.

**Acceptance:**
- The first render's lys.given entry has 4 documents, whose kinds are appended_instructions, mcp_config, claude_md_chain and memory_index in that order, and whose lengths and sha256 values equal those of the four files on disk.
- In the first render's entry, config_dir equals {path: C, source: template}, the memory_index document's path starts with C, environment contains CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, and no document has the kind user_claude_md.
- A second render of the same fixture gives a second lys.given entry whose documents list is equal to the first's in every kind, path, length and sha256, with the render-written documents compared by their out-directory-relative paths.
- After one byte of the fixture CLAUDE.md is changed (same length), a third render's entry differs from the second's in exactly one field: the claude_md_chain document's sha256. All other fields of all 4 documents are equal.
- given-check reports matches for the fixture CLAUDE.md against the second entry before the change, and differs against the second entry after it.
- A search for the fixture sentence finds 0 occurrences in the lys.given entries' lines of the session file, in the serialised given report, and in the serialised given-check reports.
- The session file's lines each parse as JSON, with the header first and every entry carrying id, parentId and timestamp.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-home/tests/given_record.rs

**Checklist:**
- C21 — Every launch-template render appends one lys.given custom entry after the render event, listing the instruction documents Claude Code will load for the session's working directory and the files the render wrote, in the order measured on the named Claude Code version, each by kind, path, byte length and SHA-256, with the harness name and version, the kinds resolved, the kinds it leaves unlisted, and the environment variable names the template set; never a document's content and never a variable's value.
- C22 — lys-home lists a session's given records with their documents, and checks a listed document against a file on disk by hash, answering matches or differs and never printing either file.

**Stories:**
- S12 (Tom, Owns the platform and reads what a session was given) — As Tom, I want every render to record which instruction documents the session was given, in the order the harness reads them, by path, length and hash, with the environment names it was set, so that I can later check a file on disk against what a session was given without anyone reading its contents.

### R7: Write lys.given into RECORD.md and the crate README

Add lys.given to the lys custom entries in RECORD.md: its data keys, the config_dir member and its two sources (template, home), the six resolved kinds and the two unlisted kinds (claude_md_imports and claude_rules, recorded by a later entry at the first request), the measured order, how a written document's path is relative to the out directory, that absent documents are omitted, and that the entry is unsigned and unencrypted and names hashes only. Add the lys.given row to the crate README's custom-type table, and add the given and given-check subcommands to it. Neither document SHALL quote any instruction document's content.

**Acceptance:**
- RECORD.md's 'The lys custom entries' section has a lys.given item naming the keys harness, harness_version, kinds, config_dir, documents and environment, the config_dir members path and source, the kinds members resolved and unlisted, the unlisted kinds claude_md_imports and claude_rules, and the document keys kind, path, length and sha256.
- The README's custom-type table has a lys.given row, and the README names the given and given-check subcommands.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/home/RECORD.md
- modify: crates/lys-home/README.md

**Checklist:**
- C21 — Every launch-template render appends one lys.given custom entry after the render event, listing the instruction documents Claude Code will load for the session's working directory and the files the render wrote, in the order measured on the named Claude Code version, each by kind, path, byte length and SHA-256, with the harness name and version, the kinds resolved, the kinds it leaves unlisted, and the environment variable names the template set; never a document's content and never a variable's value.

### R8: Record the measurement and one real render in PROOF-GIVEN.md

Write PROOF-GIVEN.md with: the Claude Code version answered by `claude --version` on this Mac, the machine whose Claude Code version the task names; the method and result of measuring the load order and slug rule from the harness's own behaviour (the order in the task, re-measured on that version); and one real session render on this Mac recorded through the template subcommand as the lys.given entry's kinds, document count, environment-name count, and each document's kind, path, length and sha256. IF the version measured differs from 2.1.283, THEN the proof SHALL say so and give the order measured on it, and the constant in R2 SHALL be that version. The proof SHALL state how many documents were probed for content by the check below and how many were skipped for having no line long enough. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT put any document content or any environment variable value in the proof.

**Acceptance:**
- PROOF-GIVEN.md names the Claude Code version, and the order of kinds it measured on that version.
- PROOF-GIVEN.md holds one real render's lys.given entry id, its document count, its environment-name count, and one line per document with kind, path, length and a 64-hex-character sha256.
- For each document the proof lists, the probe is its longest line after trimming leading and trailing whitespace, taken only when that line is at least 40 characters long; a document with no such line is skipped. A search of PROOF-GIVEN.md for each probe finds 0 occurrences, the number of documents probed plus the number skipped equals the document count the proof states, and the number probed is at least 1.

**Files:**
- create: docs/design/home/PROOF-GIVEN.md

**Checklist:**
- C23 — The Claude Code version on this Mac, the instruction load order and project slug rule measured from its own behaviour, and one real session render, are written in PROOF-GIVEN.md as paths, counts and hashes only.

**Stories:**
- S13 (Reviewer, Checks the proofs before anything relies on them) — As the reviewer, I want the instruction load order measured on a named Claude Code version and written in a proof document, so that a later version that changes the order is caught rather than assumed.

## Boundaries

- No signing, anchoring or hashing into a lys log of the given record (stage 6), and no encryption at rest (stage 3).
- No document content and no environment variable value in the entry, a report, a log line, an error, a test name or a proof document; paths, lengths, hashes, counts and variable names only.
- No field added to Pi's grammar; lys.given rides inside a custom entry only.
- The render event ct98Wv-2 writes is not altered, reordered or re-serialised.
- No file under the config directory or the working directory is written; resolution only reads.
- No harness other than Claude Code, and no recording of documents a session reads later with its own tools.
- No settings file, hook output, plugin skill or agent listing, or output style is recorded; those are later cards on the same entry shape.
- No document's content is parsed: no @-imported file or .claude/rules file is found by reading a document. Those files are named as unlisted kinds here, and recorded by the second lys.given entry the HOME-001 proxy's capture appends at the first request, which is a later unit.
- No Norn crate is depended on and no Norn code is copied.
- The design's structure array is the whole file list; a path outside it is not created.

## Verification

- python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/home exits 0.
- python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/home exits 0.
- cargo fmt --all -- --check, cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings, cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings, cargo test --workspace --all-features, cargo doc --no-deps --all-features and cargo doc --no-deps exit 0.
- sh scripts/design/gate.sh exits 0.
- grep -n 'fn ' crates/lys-home/src/harness/claude_code/mod.rs returns nothing.
- grep -rn 'norn' crates/lys-home/Cargo.toml returns nothing.
- The fixture session file from the R6 test, written out in the proof step, parses with Pi's parseSessionEntries at 3d5cbe98 through node, and its entry count equals the count lys-home reports (the command is written in PROOF-GIVEN.md).
