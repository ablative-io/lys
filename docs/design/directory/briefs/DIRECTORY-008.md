# DIRECTORY-008: Grant brief residue after PR 6

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-001
> **Blocked by:** Sign-off of this brief before it is dispatched (DIRECTORY-001 boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it)
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
> - ADR-009 — People sign in through a maintained Rauthy fork of our own — Rauthy authenticates people, and its one-provider-per-user limit is changed in a fork we maintain, ablative-io/rauthy, not contributed upstream as a prerequisite. The maintained branch is ablative, created from upstream v0.36.2 commit dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; the fork's main stays an untouched upstream mirror; lys pins an exact commit of ablative as the submodule vendor/rauthy. Upgrades rebase ablative onto upstream release tags only, each in its own gated row; no cherry-picks and no reset of main.
> **Checklist:**
> - C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
> - C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task.
> - C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.
> **Stories:**
> - S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

## Purpose

Three small items the 25 September grant-brief patch carries that main lacks after PR 6 (5593354) landed DIRECTORY-001 to DIRECTORY-006: the DIRECTORY-005 verification line for the frontend checks (R1), three design.json inventory rows for vendor/rauthy, crates/lys and docs/design/decisions.json beside the eight rows main lists (R2), and one design.json intention sentence recording that Cambium later uses this issuer keeping its participant ids, while the non-goal for rows 06 and 07 stands (R3). Main wins wherever the patch contradicts it on ADR ids and lifecycle; nothing here reopens a settled row. Documents only under docs/design/directory; no code; no new ADR; no change to any row's identifiers, estimates or dependency order.

## Task

Make the three document edits R1 to R3 on the documents as main holds them at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18 (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json:114-119, docs/design/directory/design.json:4 and docs/design/directory/design.json:580-613), re-render the cluster so each rendered twin matches its JSON, and pass the gate. Estimate: 1 focused implementer hour (R1 0.25, R2 0.5, R3 0.25), a document increment outside CN7's 48-hour ceiling, which stands unchanged; no row's estimate changes, DIRECTORY-005 keeps its 6 hours. Every path is relative to the repository root (CN3).

Ledger. Under the ruling of 26 September at 20:31 that a brief's ids are the next after main's highest and every open brief branch's, this brief is DIRECTORY-008 at docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-008.json and its roadmap row is RM-016 in docs/design/roadmap.json, appended after RM-015, which the audit receipt card's brief DIRECTORY-007 takes in the run fired beside this one; main's ledger ends at RM-010 (docs/design/roadmap.json:276) and RM-011 to RM-015 are taken on open brief branches, so RM-016 is appended as the next row with every row main holds unchanged. It records no new decision: docs/design/decisions.json is not touched. Per the settled answer B1 (round 1 of run a68a7767, 22:49): RM-016 is the brief's own ledger entry, which every brief on main has, written by the brief method the gate runs, as the brief file is written under docs/design/directory/briefs; the boundary 'documents only under docs/design/directory' governs the work R1 to R3 do when built, not the brief's own files; RM-016 is appended with every row main holds unchanged, and no other file outside docs/design/directory changes. The two structure rows for this brief's own files in design.json are the method's listing of the brief, as DIRECTORY-006's rows are (docs/design/directory/design.json:414-423), and are written on the brief branch, not by the build.

Coverage. C1, C3, C6 and S2 are claimed by DIRECTORY-001, which wrote these documents, and by this brief, which completes them with the three items; the split is noted here, as check-coverage.py allows, and is reported as a warning, not a failure.

Dev note. The build starts from the main this brief lands on, which may be later than 1756688 if DIRECTORY-007 lands first; the counts in R1 to R3 are stated against 1756688 and hold, because that brief's words touch neither DIRECTORY-005's verification nor design.json's inventory or intention. Read the four files first. Make each JSON edit as an append that keeps every existing member byte for byte: json.load, append, json.dump with indent=2 and ensure_ascii=False plus one trailing newline reproduces main's formatting exactly (checked at 1756688 for both files by a round trip). Then run python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory and commit the rendered DESIGN.md and DIRECTORY-005.md beside their JSON; the gate compares a fresh render against the committed markdown byte for byte. Run bash scripts/design/gate.sh last and commit the four files by exact path.

## Requirements

### R1: Add the frontend verification line to DIRECTORY-005

THE SYSTEM SHALL append to the verification array of docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json:114-119, four entries at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, the fourth being the ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE hold point) one fifth and last entry, exactly: 'Frontend checks pass with strict types and the generated API schema, with negative and crash-boundary tests.' The four entries main holds SHALL stay byte for byte and in their order. No other member of DIRECTORY-005 changes: not its id, depends_on, blocked_by, checklist, stories, design_anchor, purpose, task with its 6-hour estimate, requirements or boundaries. THE SYSTEM SHALL re-render docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md with python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory so its Verification section (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md:103-108 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18) lists the five entries.

**Acceptance:**
- From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json'))['verification']))" prints 5 (it prints 4 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18), and the first four entries equal, string for string, the four that git show 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18:docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json holds.
- From the repository root: rg -c 'strict types and the generated API schema' docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json prints 1, and the same command over docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md prints 1; both print nothing at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.
- From the repository root, on the build branch: git diff --no-ext-diff --numstat <base>..HEAD -- docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json prints 2 added and 1 deleted (the new entry's line and the fourth entry's line gaining its trailing comma), where <base> is the commit the build started from.
- From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json')); print(d['task'].count('6 focused implementer hours'), d['depends_on'])" prints 1 ['DIRECTORY-004'], as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md

**Checklist:**
- C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task.
- C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

#### R1 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Accept 1: met. The verification array has 5 entries, and the first four were left untouched by the append (the dump round trip is byte-identical, checked before editing). Accept 2: met. rg -c prints 1 for docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json (line 119) and 1 for DIRECTORY-005.md (line 109). Accept 3: met. The working-tree git diff --numstat for DIRECTORY-005.json is '2 1': the new line plus the fourth entry gaining its comma. Accept 4: met. The check prints 1 ['DIRECTORY-004'].
- Deviation: I ran python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory once, because R1 to R3 require the re-render and it is the only way to produce the rendered twins. I ran no other listed check, build, lint or test, and made no commit, as instructed.
- Files changed:
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json` — The verification array now holds five entries. The fifth, at line 119, is 'Frontend checks pass with strict types and the generated API schema, with negative and crash-boundary tests.' Every other member is unchanged.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md` — Re-rendered. The Verification section lists the five entries, with the new one at line 109.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task. — DIRECTORY-005 keeps its id, depends_on, estimate and ID001 identifiers. Only the verification line was added.
  - [x] C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean. — The rendered twin was regenerated from the JSON.
- Story delivery:
  - [x] S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria. — The brief now carries the frontend verification line for review.

The phrase is absent at base.
  - [x] From the repository root, on the build branch: git diff --no-ext-diff --numstat <base>..HEAD -- docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json prints 2 added and 1 deleted (the new entry's line and the fourth entry's line gaining its trailing comma), where <base> is the commit the build started from. — git diff --no-ext-diff --numstat against base 3c1a3b9 (working tree, not yet committed) prints '2	1	docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json'.

### R2: Add the three inventory rows beside what main lists

THE SYSTEM SHALL append three rows to the inventory array of docs/design/directory/design.json (docs/design/directory/design.json:580-613, eight rows at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, ending with docs/design/identity/RAUTHY-BASELINE.md at docs/design/directory/design.json:606 and docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md at docs/design/directory/design.json:610), after the eight and in this order, each with its path and a note of what exists there at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18: (1) path 'vendor/rauthy', note 'the maintained Rauthy fork (ADR-009), the git submodule pinned at dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662, the upstream v0.36.2 commit the ablative branch was created from; DIRECTORY-004 moves the pin (structure row); read here, never changed by a document row'; (2) path 'crates/lys', note 'the lys CLI crate: Cargo.toml, src/main.rs, src/cli.rs and src/commands/ (attest, ca, key, log, inspect, files); DIRECTORY-002 adds src/identity/ and the identity subcommand to it (structure rows)'; (3) path 'docs/design/decisions.json', note 'the project decision ledger, ADR-001 to ADR-018 at main, holding the decisions this cluster cites (ADR-003, ADR-004, ADR-005, ADR-007 to ADR-011); DIRECTORY-001 recorded that it gained the identity decisions (structure row); read here, never changed by a document row'. The eight rows main lists SHALL stay byte for byte and in their order. No structure row, principle, goal, non-goal, constraint or gate leg changes. THE SYSTEM SHALL re-render docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md with python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory so its Inventory section (docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md:167-176 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18) lists the eleven rows.

**Acceptance:**
- From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json'))['inventory']))" prints 11 (it prints 8 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18), and the first eight rows equal, member for member, the eight that git show 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18:docs/design/directory/design.json holds.
- From the repository root: rg -c '"path": "vendor/rauthy"' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 2 (1 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, the structure row at docs/design/directory/design.json:380); rg -c '"path": "crates/lys"' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 1 (nothing at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18); rg -c '"path": "docs/design/decisions.json"' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 2 (1 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, the structure row at docs/design/directory/design.json:140).

**Checklist:**
- C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
- C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

#### R2 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Accept 1: met. len(inventory) is 11, and the first eight rows were left unchanged by the append. Accept 2: met. '"path": "vendor/rauthy"' counts 2 (lines 380 and 624), '"path": "crates/lys"' counts 1 (line 628), and '"path": "docs/design/decisions.json"' counts 2 (lines 140 and 632). Accept 3: met. Each of the three '^- `...`' patterns matches once in DESIGN.md, at lines 179, 180 and 181. Accept 4: met. inventory[8:] paths are ['vendor/rauthy', 'crates/lys', 'docs/design/decisions.json'], and the RAUTHY-BASELINE and CONFORMANCE rows were not touched, so that count stays 2.
- Deviation: (none)
- Files changed:

  - modified: `docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md` — Re-rendered. The Inventory section lists the eleven rows, with the new three at lines 179 to 181.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling. — The inventory now also records the fork, the CLI crate and the decision ledger. No other design member changed.
  - [x] C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean. — DESIGN.md was re-rendered from design.json.

### R3: Record the Cambium direction in the intention while the non-goal stands

THE SYSTEM SHALL append one sentence to the intention of docs/design/directory/design.json (docs/design/directory/design.json:4 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, one sentence ending 'every identity change.'), after one space, exactly: 'Cambium later uses this issuer, keeping its participant ids (rows 06 and 07); that direction is recorded here while rows 06 and 07 stay the non-goal recorded below, and this sentence promises neither row.' The non-goal for rows 06 and 07 (docs/design/directory/design.json:63-66, text 'Rows 06 (connect Cambium) and 07 (gate, install and demonstrate the release)' with its reason) SHALL stay byte for byte; no other member of the intention, and no goal, principle, non-goal, structure row, constraint or gate leg, changes. THE SYSTEM SHALL re-render docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md with python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory so its Intention section (docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md:11-13 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18) carries the sentence.

**Acceptance:**
- From the repository root: rg -c 'keeping its participant ids' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 1 and the same command over docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md prints 1; both print nothing at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/design.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md

**Checklist:**
- C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
- C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

#### R3 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Accept 1: met. 'keeping its participant ids' counts 1 in design.json (line 4) and 1 in DESIGN.md. Accept 2: met. The intention starts with the operator sentence and ends with 'and this sentence promises neither row.' Accept 3: met. The non-goals were not edited, so the Rows 06/07 text is still present and non_goals still has 11 entries (measured). Accept 4: met. goals, principles and constraints measure 5, 9 and 12.
- Deviation: (none)
- Files changed:
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/design.json` — At line 4 the intention now ends with one space and then the exact Cambium sentence. The non-goals were not changed.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md` — Re-rendered. The Intention section (line 13) carries the sentence.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling. — The outcome now records the Cambium direction, and the non-goal is kept.
  - [x] C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean. — DESIGN.md was re-rendered.
- Story delivery:
  - [x] S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria. — The direction is recorded without promising any row.

**Review (recorded):**

- Alignment: aligned
- Acceptance verdicts:
  - [x] From the repository root: rg -c 'keeping its participant ids' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 1 and the same command over docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md prints 1; both print nothing at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18. — Prints 1 for design.json and 1 for DESIGN.md.
  - [x] From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; i=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json'))['intention']; print(i.startswith('An operator installs the identity product without Cambium or Manifold, signs in,') and i.endswith('and this sentence promises neither row.'))" prints True. — Prints True. The intention also equals the base intention + ' ' + the exact spec sentence (True).
  - [x] From the repository root: rg -c 'Rows 06 \(connect Cambium\) and 07 \(gate, install and demonstrate the release\)' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 1, as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, and python3 -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json'))['non_goals']))" prints 11, as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18. — rg -c prints 1, and len(non_goals) is 11. non_goals equals the base value (True).
  - [x] From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json')); print(len(d['goals']), len(d['principles']), len(d['constraints']))" prints 5 9 12, as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18. — Prints 5 9 12. Against HEAD, only intention and inventory differ in design.json.

## Boundaries

- Documents only under docs/design/directory: the build changes exactly the four files R1 to R3 name (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json, docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md, docs/design/directory/design.json, docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md) and nothing else; no code; no file under crates/, surface/, deploy/, vendor/, scripts/ or tests/; docs/design/decisions.json is not touched either, narrower than CN1.
- No new ADR: docs/design/decisions.json is unchanged; this brief's design_anchor cites decisions that exist at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18 and it records no decision.
- No change to any row's identifiers, estimates or dependency order: every brief id, roadmap id, ADR id, C, S, R and ID001 identifier, every estimate (DIRECTORY-005's 6 hours, CN7's ceiling) and every depends_on array stays as main holds it.
- Main wins wherever the 25 September patch contradicts it on ADR ids and lifecycle: nothing from the patch beyond the three items is carried, and no settled row reopens.
- The non-goal for rows 06 and 07 stands: the intention sentence records a direction and promises no row, no Cambium cluster and no cross-repository arrangement.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- The roadmap row RM-016 in docs/design/roadmap.json is this brief's own ledger entry, written on the brief branch by this brief and never by the build; per the settled answer B1 of 22:49 it stands outside the 'documents only under docs/design/directory' boundary, which governs the build's work (R1 to R3). The build changes no file outside docs/design/directory.
- No credential, token or key value is written in any document.
- No row is dispatched until this brief is signed off.

## Verification

- From the repository root: bash scripts/design/gate.sh exits 0 (scripts/design/gate.sh: validate.py over docs/design/decisions.json, docs/design/project.json and every cluster, check-coverage.py over every cluster, and render-cluster.py into a temporary copy compared byte for byte with the committed markdown).
- From the repository root, on the build branch: git diff --no-ext-diff --name-only <base>..HEAD prints exactly four paths, docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md, docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json, docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md and docs/design/directory/design.json, where <base> is the commit the build started from; git diff --no-ext-diff --name-only <base>..HEAD -- . ':!docs/design/directory' prints nothing.
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0; the coverage report may list C1, C3, C6 and S2 as claimed by DIRECTORY-001 and DIRECTORY-008, a warning whose split this brief's task notes, and lists no failure.
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory run a second time changes no file (git status --porcelain docs/design/directory prints nothing after it).
