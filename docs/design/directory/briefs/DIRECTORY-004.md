# DIRECTORY-004: Link two upstream providers to one Rauthy person

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-003
> **Blocked by:** The fork-owned brief for row 03's Rauthy changes, which does not yet exist: a brief in the ablative-io/rauthy fork's own repository (vendor/rauthy, branch ablative; maintenance owner Chippy, Waffles reviewing, docs/design/identity/RAUTHY-BASELINE.md:39) carrying the fork files R1 names. This brief is not executable until that brief exists and has landed on a gated fork commit, Waffles' review of this brief before it is dispatched (DIRECTORY-001 boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it)
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-009 — People sign in through a maintained Rauthy fork of our own — Rauthy authenticates people, and its one-provider-per-user limit is changed in a fork we maintain, ablative-io/rauthy, not contributed upstream as a prerequisite. The maintained branch is ablative, created from upstream v0.36.2 commit dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; the fork's main stays an untouched upstream mirror; lys pins an exact commit of ablative as the submodule vendor/rauthy. Upgrades rebase ablative onto upstream release tags only, each in its own gated row; no cherry-picks and no reset of main.
> **Checklist:**
> - C16 — The pinned fork commit links Google and GitHub to one unchanged Rauthy person, refuses every collision and replay, migrates both storages and audits each link atomically (ID001_LINK_PAIR, ID001_LINK_REFUSAL, ID001_LINK_MIGRATION, ID001_LINK_AUDIT).
> - C17 — The provider-link contract and the links report are written, and the report names the gated fork commit the pin moves to.
> **Stories:**
> - S5 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As a person signing in, I want Google and GitHub to resolve to the one me, so that adding a provider never splits me into two people or merges me with someone who shares my email.

## Purpose

Row 03 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5: Google and GitHub resolve to one Rauthy person, collisions are refused rather than merged by email, and each link and unlink is audited atomically and acknowledged by the receiver DIRECTORY-003 built. The linking change lives in the maintained fork (ADR-009), a repository of its own; this brief is the lys side of the row: the pin, the provider-link contract and the report.

## Task

Carry IDENTITY-001 revision 5 row 03 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:208-262). The fork's files are the fork-owned brief's (blocked_by) and are named in R1's spec with their owner, never listed in files (CN4). This brief moves vendor/rauthy to the fork commit that brief lands and gates (R1), and writes the provider-link contract and the links report (R2). Estimate: 10 focused implementer hours, revision 5's figure for the whole row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:261), shared between this brief and the fork-owned brief; no re-estimate, and the split is stated when the fork-owned brief is written. The row's live demonstration, ID001_LINK_LIVE, is a verification step after the row lands and holds DIRECTORY-005 (CN6).

## Requirements

### R1: Move the pin to the gated fork commit that links two providers to one person

THE SYSTEM SHALL move the vendor/rauthy submodule pin to a commit on the fork's ablative branch that carries the linking change and has passed the fork-owned brief's gate (ADR-009); the pin never names an ungated or cherry-picked commit.

The linking change, owned by the fork-owned brief and named here only (owner: the ablative-io/rauthy fork, maintained by Chippy with Waffles reviewing; paths relative to the fork's root, from revision 5's wall, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:216-238): src/api/src/auth_providers.rs, src/api_types/src/auth_providers.rs, src/api_types/src/users.rs, src/data/src/entity/auth_providers.rs, src/data/src/entity/users.rs, src/data/src/entity/mod.rs, src/data/src/entity/identity_links.rs, src/data/src/entity/identity_link_audit.rs, src/data/src/migration/inserts.rs, src/service/src/oidc/auth_providers/login_finish.rs, src/service/src/oidc/auth_providers/login_start.rs, frontend/src/api/types/auth_provider.ts, frontend/src/api/types/user.ts, frontend/src/lib/account/AccMain.svelte, frontend/src/lib/account/AccOther.svelte, frontend/src/lib/account/AccLinkedProviders.svelte, frontend/src/lib/admin/users/UserInfo.svelte, frontend/src/routes/providers/callback/+page.svelte, migrations/hiqlite/32_identity_links.sql, migrations/postgres/V27__identity_links.sql, tests/identity_links/. Its work, from revision 5 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:246-249): replace the single provider pair with a link relation unique on provider and subject, migrating existing links transactionally without changing Rauthy user IDs, with row 01's exact migration filenames confirmed before code starts; require an authenticated person, fresh reauthentication and a single-use target-bound linking intent, bind state, nonce, provider and callback, and reject identity collision instead of merging by matching email; update every reader row 01 found, including administrative deletion, export and import; list links, and unlink only after confirming the identity keeps a usable authentication or recovery method, preserving upstream account security controls; commit link or unlink and its audit provenance atomically through the minimal durable link-audit design selected in row 01, and label the audit complete only on an acknowledged Lys receipt from the DIRECTORY-003 receiver, so a duplicate delivery never creates another identity event.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_LINK_PAIR: Google then GitHub, and GitHub then Google, resolve to one unchanged user subject; sign out and back in through either provider and reopen storage.
- ID001_LINK_REFUSAL: same email with different subject, already-owned provider identity, replayed/cross-account intent, CSRF/nonce mismatch and final-login unlink are refused with no unintended link.
- ID001_LINK_MIGRATION: both supported storage migrations preserve IDs and links, restart safely after interruption and refuse incompatible schema versions by name.
- ID001_LINK_AUDIT: crash after database commit but before audit acknowledgement retains the outbox; delivery/retry yields one logical signed event. Audit outage is visible, never a false completed receipt.
- vendor/rauthy names a commit on the ablative branch whose fork gate passed, and the four identifiers above are each found in that commit's tests under vendor/rauthy/tests/identity_links/.

**Files:**
- modify: vendor/rauthy

**Checklist:**
- C16 — The pinned fork commit links Google and GitHub to one unchanged Rauthy person, refuses every collision and replay, migrates both storages and audits each link atomically (ID001_LINK_PAIR, ID001_LINK_REFUSAL, ID001_LINK_MIGRATION, ID001_LINK_AUDIT).

**Stories:**
- S5 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As a person signing in, I want Google and GitHub to resolve to the one me, so that adding a provider never splits me into two people or merges me with someone who shares my email.

### R2: Write the provider-link contract and the links report

THE SYSTEM SHALL write docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md, the typed contract between the fork's link audit and the DIRECTORY-003 receiver (stable source operation IDs, pending and acknowledged states, what an issuer observes as against what a person claims), and docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md, the report of the row: the fork commit the pin moves to, its gate result, the counted legs of each ID001_LINK_* case and the development install's release-and-advisory check (CN10). Both keep the file names revision 5 gives this row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:241-242).

**Acceptance:**
- docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md names every field the receiver reads and the states a link audit passes through, and the DIRECTORY-003 receiver's fixtures match it.
- docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md names the pinned fork commit, its gate result and the count of exercised legs per identifier, and records the release-and-advisory check of the install.

**Files:**
- create: docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md
- create: docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md

**Checklist:**
- C17 — The provider-link contract and the links report are written, and the report names the gated fork commit the pin moves to.

**Stories:**
- S5 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As a person signing in, I want Google and GitHub to resolve to the one me, so that adding a provider never splits me into two people or merges me with someone who shares my email.

## Boundaries

- Only the files listed in this brief's requirements change; a row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and Waffles approves a brief revision before that file is edited (CN9).
- Development isolation: disposable test identities and test provider registrations only; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration (CN2).
- No credential, token or key value is written in code, tests, fixtures, logs or documents; tests use generated values that are never real credentials.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- A live demonstration to Tom is a verification step a person performs after the row lands, never an acceptance criterion and never claimed by a loop completion (CN5, CN6).
- No row is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it.
- No fork file is edited by this brief: the fork's changes land through the fork-owned brief and its gate, and reach this repository only as a pin.
- No cherry-pick and no nightly base: rows 02 to 05 run on v0.36.2 (CN10).

## Verification

- From the repository root: cargo fmt --check; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps, all clean (CLAUDE.md, gates before any commit).
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0.
- From the repository root, with submodules checked out: rg -n 'ID001_LINK_PAIR|ID001_LINK_REFUSAL|ID001_LINK_MIGRATION|ID001_LINK_AUDIT' vendor/rauthy/tests/identity_links finds each identifier in a test.
- ID001_LINK_LIVE, after the row lands (CN5, CN6): a person installs the exact gated fork and shows Tom two linked providers resolving to one person in Rauthy's own account page, signing in through both, then posts a separate install and showing receipt to Tom with the Melbourne pass time, fork ref, artifact hash and observed result. A venue test or screenshot alone does not replace the live demonstration, and DIRECTORY-005 stays blocked until the receipt is recorded.
