# DIRECTORY-001: Revise the identity directory plan for human-rooted grants, as design-system briefs

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
> - ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
> - ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL, possibly on a network device — PostgreSQL is used for the identity product's database. It may be set up on one of the network devices rather than on Tom's Mac.
> **Checklist:**
> - C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
> - C2 — The project decision ledger holds the identity decisions with their authority and quote: the maintained Rauthy fork, one PostgreSQL service and database (ADR-005, already recorded), the product accents, and the lifecycle states as working team decisions marked proposed.
> - C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task.
> - C4 — The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement with acceptance criteria in the row that owns it, and row 02 states what SpiceDB enforces in step 1 and what it does not.
> - C5 — Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open: the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor, and nightly versus waiting for the upstream release.
> - C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.
> **Stories:**
> - S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.
> - S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

## Purpose

Rewrite the identity plan so every grant traces back to a person (Tom, 22 September 17:15), with the PostgreSQL decision and the four lifecycle states in, as design-system briefs the loop can build. Documents only; comes before any code.

## Task

Read IDENTITY-001.json revision 5 in full, the statement's section 'Everything is pegged to a human authority', LIFECYCLE-STATES, PROVISIONING, AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23 (its examples are undecided and are not requirements), and ADR-005 in docs/design/decisions.json, which already records Tom's PostgreSQL ruling. Add the identity decisions to docs/design/decisions.json, complete this cluster's design, checklist and stories, and write DIRECTORY-002 (row 02, 8 hours), DIRECTORY-003 (row 04, 10 hours), DIRECTORY-004 (row 03, 10 hours) and DIRECTORY-005 (row 05, 6 hours), each depending on the one before, revision 5's 48-hour ceiling kept and any re-estimate stated. Carry every ID001 acceptance identifier forward unchanged. Every path in a document of this cluster is relative to the repository root, even though the session starts in docs/.

## Requirements

### R1: Record the identity decisions and complete the directory design

THE SYSTEM SHALL add to docs/design/decisions.json one ADR per identity decision named in C2 that the ledger does not already hold (ADR-005, PostgreSQL, is already there and is cited, not rewritten), each with its authority, date, decider and, where the source holds Tom's own words, the quote; a working team decision SHALL be status proposed, never decided. The directory design SHALL gain those ADR ids and SHALL keep revision 5's outcome, shared contract, constraints and non-goals, revised for the grant ruling. Each ADR's source SHALL be cited from IDENTITY-001's authority or review_decisions, the statement, or the lifecycle document; nothing is invented.

**Acceptance:**
- validate.py reports decisions.json and design.json valid.
- Every ADR added cites its source, and the lifecycle states ADR is status proposed.
- ADR-005 is unchanged and the directory design anchors to it.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/decisions.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/design.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md

**Checklist:**
- C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
- C2 — The project decision ledger holds the identity decisions with their authority and quote: the maintained Rauthy fork, one PostgreSQL service and database (ADR-005, already recorded), the product accents, and the lifecycle states as working team decisions marked proposed.

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.

### R2: Carry rows 02, 04, 03 and 05 into design-system briefs

THE SYSTEM SHALL write DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005 from revision 5's rows 02, 04, 03 and 05, each valid against the brief schema: its work as requirements, its wall as files (a file in the Rauthy fork, which is its own repository under vendor/rauthy, is named in the spec with its owner and is not listed in files), its acceptance as criteria keeping every ID001 identifier, its dependencies as depends_on, its estimate in its task. A live demonstration to Tom SHALL be a verification step, never an acceptance criterion. Every path a row brief lists SHALL gain a structure row in design.json. DIRECTORY-004 (row 03) SHALL carry in blocked_by the fork-owned brief that does not yet exist, named as such, so it is never an executable brief with an empty wall. DIRECTORY-005 SHALL carry in blocked_by the ID001_LINK_LIVE demonstration to Tom, and the design's hold point for ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE SHALL be kept, per CN6.

**Acceptance:**
- DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005 exist and validate.py reports each valid.
- Each ID001 acceptance identifier of rows 02, 04, 03 and 05 appears in its brief.
- depends_on runs DIRECTORY-002, then 003, then 004, then 005, matching revision 5's order 02, 04, 03, 05.
- No acceptance criterion requires a live demonstration; each row's demonstration appears under verification.
- check-coverage.py reports every listed path present in the structure.
- DIRECTORY-004's blocked_by names the missing fork-owned brief.
- DIRECTORY-005's blocked_by names the ID001_LINK_LIVE demonstration.

**Files:**
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.md
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.md
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-004.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-004.md
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md
- modify: docs/design/directory/design.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md

**Checklist:**
- C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

### R3: Put the grant path and the enforcement boundary in the row that owns them

THE SYSTEM SHALL make the grant path named in C4 a requirement, with acceptance criteria, in the row brief the sources place it in, and SHALL state in DIRECTORY-002 what SpiceDB enforces in step 1 and what it does not. Where the sources do not settle which row owns the grant path, the brief SHALL record that as open for Tom and SHALL NOT pick one.

**Acceptance:**
- The grant path appears as one requirement with criteria for allowed-before-revoke and refused-after-revoke, or is recorded as open with the question stated.
- DIRECTORY-002 states SpiceDB's step-1 role in one sentence.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json

**Checklist:**
- C4 — The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement with acceptance criteria in the row that owns it, and row 02 states what SpiceDB enforces in step 1 and what it does not.

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.

### R4: Mark the open decisions open and keep the cluster covered

THE SYSTEM SHALL record each open decision named in C5 in the design's non-goals or the owning brief as open for Tom, deciding none of them, and SHALL add the rows' checklist items and stories so that every one is named by a row brief and the rendered markdown matches the JSON.

**Acceptance:**
- Each open decision in C5 appears once, marked open.
- check-coverage.py exits 0.
- render-cluster.py leaves the rendered markdown unchanged after the commit.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/checklist.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/CHECKLIST.md
- modify: docs/design/directory/stories.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/USER-STORIES.md

**Checklist:**
- C5 — Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open: the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor, and nightly versus waiting for the upstream release.
- C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

## Boundaries

- Documents only: only docs/design/directory/ and docs/design/decisions.json change; the IDENTITY-001 files, and everything else, stay byte for byte.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided.
- Rows 06 and 07 are not written here.
- No credential, token or key value is written.
- No row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it.

## Verification

- From docs/: python3 $DS2_METHOD/scripts/validate.py design/directory exits 0.
- From docs/: python3 $DS2_METHOD/scripts/validate.py design/decisions.json exits 0.
- From docs/: python3 $DS2_METHOD/scripts/check-coverage.py design/directory exits 0.
