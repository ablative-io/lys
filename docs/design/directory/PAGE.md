# directory — what was asked, what it means, and what was written

## The words, as they were typed

The brief for this card already stands in the cluster: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-004.json and DIRECTORY-004.md, "Link two upstream providers to one Rauthy person", Row 03 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5, landed with lys PR 6. This card is the one that carries it; its twin PLMigKDB on board 2 was archived into this card. Read DIRECTORY-004 in full and carry it as this card's brief. Keep its two requirements exactly. R1 moves the pin to the gated fork commit that links two providers (Google and GitHub) to one person, with a collision refused rather than merged. R2 writes the provider-link contract and the links report. Keep its boundaries and verification as written, and change nothing the method (scripts/design/validate.py, check-coverage.py, render-cluster.py, run by scripts/design/gate.sh) does not require.

Facts the brief already settles, which the survey must not reopen, follow. The link lives in the maintained Rauthy fork (ADR-009), never in an upstream contribution. This row is built after DIRECTORY-003 (the directory contract and its link-audit receiver, Row 04) and after DIRECTORY-002 (the install). Every link is recorded through that receiver. The row ends in a live demonstration to Tom (ID001_LINK_LIVE), and a venue test or a screenshot does not replace it. Test identities only; no production key; Tom's acts stay Tom's.

If the survey finds a sentence of DIRECTORY-004 open or contradicted by the repository as it stands, quote that sentence as a question for the lead rather than rewriting the brief around it.

## What the survey found, and its angles

The words make DIRECTORY-004 ("Link two upstream providers to one Rauthy person", Row 03 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5, landed in PR 6) this card's brief, unchanged. R1 moves the vendor/rauthy pin to a gated commit on the fork's ablative branch where Google and GitHub link to one Rauthy person and a collision is refused, not merged. R2 writes docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md and docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md. The brief is not executable yet. Its fork-side work has no brief and no commit. The ablative branch is still at the v0.36.2 base. DIRECTORY-002 (the install) and DIRECTORY-003 (the receiver) are not built in this tree.

### What the tree holds

- `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-004.json` — The brief the card carries: R1 (the vendor/rauthy pin, acceptance ID001_LINK_PAIR/REFUSAL/MIGRATION/AUDIT) and R2 (the two documents). It has 2 blocked_by entries: the fork-owned brief that does not exist yet, and Waffles' review. Validates OK against brief.schema.json today.
- `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-004.md` — The rendered twin. gate.sh fails if it drifts from the JSON, so the card must not edit either file unless the method requires it.
- `vendor/rauthy` — R1's only file. A submodule pinned at dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662 (v0.36.2), last moved in 146796f. It is not checked out in this clone (git submodule status shows '-'). .gitmodules tracks branch ablative.
- `docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md` — R2 creates it: the typed contract between the fork's link audit and the DIRECTORY-003 receiver. It does not exist yet.
- `docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md` — R2 creates it: pinned commit, gate result, counted legs per ID001_LINK_* case, and the release-and-advisory check. Neither the file nor the reports/ directory exists yet. DIRECTORY-002 R1 also creates a file there.
- `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json` — R4 builds the link-audit receiver 'against the reviewed typed contract and fixtures before DIRECTORY-004 needs it'. DIRECTORY-004 R2's acceptance says the receiver's fixtures match PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md. The two orderings meet here.
- `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.json` — The install that ID001_LINK_LIVE and the report's release-and-advisory check stand on: deploy/identity/*, crates/lys/src/identity/*. None of it exists in the tree (no deploy/ directory).
- `docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json` — Revision 5 row 03 at lines 209-262: the rauthy wall at 216-238, the lys wall at 239-243, work at 245-250, estimate at 261. review_decisions choose the same-transaction link audit record/outbox, the 'minimal durable link-audit design selected in row 01' that R1 relies on.
- `docs/design/identity/RAUTHY-BASELINE.md` — Row 01's evidence (112 lines): provider-field inventory, the three wall additions, no native link event, and 'No final table/transport design chosen and no table added'. Also names the IDENTITY-001-UPSTREAM-AUTH-STATE blocker and Chippy as fork owner with Waffles reviewing.
- `docs/design/directory/design.json` — The cluster's constraints CN1-CN12. CN4: fork files are named with their owner, never listed. CN5/CN6: ID001_LINK_LIVE is a hold point. CN9: the wall is fixed. CN10: v0.36.2 with an advisory check per install. The non-goal 'Row 03's changes inside the Rauthy fork' is also here. The structure rows assign vendor/rauthy and the two documents to DIRECTORY-004.
- `scripts/design/gate.sh` — The method gate the words name (validate.py, check-coverage.py, render-cluster.py with a byte comparison of rendered markdown). Exit 0 on the tree as it stands.
- `ablative-io/rauthy@ablative (Cargo.toml, migrations/, tests/)` — The fork's root Cargo.toml is a virtual workspace with members = ["src/*"], and no tests/ directory exists at the pinned commit. A root-level tests/identity_links/ is therefore not compiled by cargo unless the fork-owned brief wires it. The next migration numbers (postgres V27, hiqlite 32) match the wall's filenames.

### What was already decided

- ADR-009 — People sign in through the maintained ablative-io/rauthy fork, branch ablative from v0.36.2 dd61ac3. lys pins an exact commit. Release-tag rebases only; no cherry-picks; no upstream prerequisite.
- ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority. Linking providers must never split one person or merge two by email.
- ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL. ID001_LINK_MIGRATION covers both Rauthy storages (postgres and hiqlite).
- ADR-011 — Proposed lifecycle states. A person is registered at first sign-in, so a link must keep the one enduring identity.
- DIRECTORY-001 — Boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it. The conversion kept IDENTITY-001's files unchanged as the record of revision 5.
- DIRECTORY-003 — R4 builds the authenticated link-audit receiver against a reviewed typed contract. It dedupes stable operation IDs, returns verifiable receipts and separates issuer observations from human-signed claims (ID001_RECEIVER).
- DIRECTORY-005 — Depends on DIRECTORY-004 and stays blocked until the ID001_LINK_LIVE receipt is recorded (CN6).
- directory CN4 — A file in another repository is named in a requirement's spec with its owner, never in files or structure.
- directory CN5/CN6 — A live demonstration is never a loop acceptance criterion. ID001_LINK_LIVE is a mandatory hold point after row 03.
- directory CN9 — A row needing a file outside its wall stops. The reviewer approves a brief revision before that file is edited.
- directory CN10 — Rows 02-05 run on v0.36.2 under Waffles' 15:36:25 ruling. Each development install records a release-and-advisory check.
- directory non_goal (Row 03 fork changes) — The fork is its own repository and needs its own brief, which does not exist and blocks DIRECTORY-004.
- directory non_goal (nightly base) — Nightly Rauthy versus waiting for a release carrying #1696/#1728 is OPEN for Tom.
- IDENTITY-001 row 03 — Revision 5's wall, work, the five ID001_LINK_* acceptances and a 10-hour estimate for the whole row, shared with the fork.
- IDENTITY-001 review_decisions — Chooses a narrowly scoped same-transaction link audit record or outbox with stable operation IDs and pending/acknowledged state, subject to review of the minimal diff.
- IDENTITY-001 shared_contract — Receipts carry version, stable operation ID, actor, affected identity, operation, payload commitment and log coordinate. Exact signed encoding is reviewed before use.
- RM-001 — Briefed: the identity directory, including two upstream providers linked to one person. DIRECTORY-004 is one of its briefs.
- RM-003 — Idea: a future rebase of the fork, whose acceptance includes 'the provider-link behaviour of DIRECTORY-004 still holds'.

### What was measured

- Requirements in DIRECTORY-004: 2 (R1, R2)
- Acceptance lines: R1: 5 (four ID001_LINK_* plus the pin check); R2: 2
- Files this repository changes under DIRECTORY-004: 3: modify vendor/rauthy; create PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md and reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md
- Fork paths named in R1's spec (the fork-owned wall): 21 entries (20 files + tests/identity_links/)
- blocked_by entries on DIRECTORY-004: 2
- DIRECTORY-004 sizes: JSON 9,588 bytes; MD 11,203 bytes
- Current vendor/rauthy pin: dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662 (v0.36.2)
- Remote ablative-io/rauthy refs/heads/ablative: dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; ahead_by 0 commits vs the base, so no linking commit exists
- Upstream latest release (gh api repos/sebadob/rauthy/releases/latest): v0.36.2, published 2026-08-08
- Highest existing migrations at the pinned commit: postgres V26__client_resource_indicators.sql (26 files); hiqlite 31_client_resource_indicators.sql (31 files). The wall's V27 and 32 are the next numbers.
- Wall files already present at the pinned commit (sampled): Present: login_finish.rs 5,016 B; login_start.rs 3,698 B; api_types auth_providers.rs 8,119 B; AccOther.svelte 3,636 B; callback +page.svelte 6,827 B. Absent: identity_links.rs, identity_link_audit.rs, AccLinkedProviders.svelte
- Top-level tests/ directory in the fork at the pin: absent; root Cargo.toml is a virtual workspace with members = ["src/*"]
- DIRECTORY-003 receiver in this tree: absent (no crates/lys-identity, no crates/lys-identity-server, no tests/identity_contract)
- DIRECTORY-002 install in this tree: absent (no deploy/ directory, no crates/lys/src/identity)
- docs/design/identity/reports/ directory: absent
- sh scripts/design/gate.sh on HEAD 7b53625: exit 0: directory has 7 briefs, 30 checklist items, 12 stories, coverage clean, 6 shared-claim warnings
- Estimate for the whole row: 10 focused hours (IDENTITY-001.json:261), shared with the fork-owned brief
- crates in the workspace: 6 (lys, lys-anchor, lys-anchor-cli, lys-core, lys-home, lys-log-store)

### What it means for the other projects

- cambium — The card lives on a Cambium board, and its twin PLMigKDB on board 2 is archived into it. No Cambium code changes: rows 06/07 (connecting Cambium, keeping participant ids) stay a non-goal, and there is no live Cambium participant migration (CN2). The fork-owned brief probably needs its own Cambium card so it goes through the chain.
- aion — The workflow chain (brief_card, sign-off, card_build_v3, src_pr, src_land) carries this card. Its inputs must name a repository and a commit. The fork work is in ablative-io/rauthy, a different repository, so it needs its own chain run. This card's build is only a pin move plus two documents once the fork commit is gated.
- method — scripts/design/validate.py, check-coverage.py and render-cluster.py (via gate.sh) come from the design-system method. The brief already passes them; the card needs no method change.
- argus — Gates run through the queue at the venue (Dean's laptop). IDENTITY-001 records the Argus gate-timeout path as Heimdall's, so gate submission for the fork and this row depends on it.

### The decisions it stands on

- ADR-009 (honour) — The pin moves only to a gated commit on the ablative branch. No cherry-pick, no upstream contribution, fork main untouched.
- ADR-003 (honour) — A collision is refused rather than merged by email, so linking never splits a person or joins two people.
- ADR-005 (honour) — ID001_LINK_MIGRATION migrates the PostgreSQL storage the install uses, as well as hiqlite, preserving Rauthy user IDs.
- ADR-011 (honour) — The person registered at first sign-in keeps one enduring identity through provider additions.
- ADR-010 (honour) — The fork's account-page changes (AccLinkedProviders.svelte and others) take the themed colours; purple is not used.

### What it requires

- vendor/rauthy names a commit on ablative-io/rauthy branch ablative, different from dd61ac3, that passed the fork-owned brief's gate and is not a cherry-pick.
- rg -n 'ID001_LINK_PAIR|ID001_LINK_REFUSAL|ID001_LINK_MIGRATION|ID001_LINK_AUDIT' vendor/rauthy/tests/identity_links finds each of the four identifiers in a test at the pinned commit.
- docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md exists, names every field the DIRECTORY-003 receiver reads, stable source operation IDs and the pending and acknowledged states, separates issuer observation from person claim, and the receiver's fixtures match it.
- docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md exists and names the pinned fork commit, its gate result, the count of exercised legs for each ID001_LINK_* identifier, and the release-and-advisory check of the development install.
- The six cargo gates (fmt --check, clippy in both feature shapes, test --workspace --all-features, doc in both feature shapes) pass, run at the venue.
- sh scripts/design/gate.sh exits 0, with DIRECTORY-004.json and DIRECTORY-004.md unchanged or changed only as the method requires.
- No files change other than vendor/rauthy and the two R2 documents.
- ID001_LINK_LIVE is recorded as a hold point after landing. No loop completion claims it, and DIRECTORY-005 stays blocked until Tom's receipt is recorded.

### What must not change

- R1 and R2 of DIRECTORY-004 are kept exactly. Its boundaries and verification stay as written.
- No fork file is edited from this repository. Fork changes arrive only as a pin.
- No cherry-pick, no nightly base, no reset of fork main. Rows 02-05 stay on v0.36.2 (CN10).
- The IDENTITY-001 files stay unchanged as the record of revision 5.
- No credential, token or key value appears in code, tests, fixtures, logs or documents. Test identities and test provider registrations only.
- Decisions open for Tom stay open: nightly versus waiting, grant representation, suspension semantics, service name, anchor choice.
- lys-core, its cryptographic primitives and its published wire formats are unchanged.
- The card is not hand-built and no lead reviews in place of the chain. Heavy builds and gates run on Dean's laptop.

### What we must put in place first

- DIRECTORY-002 built and landed: the standalone install under deploy/identity and the lys identity CLI.
- DIRECTORY-003 built and landed, including R4's link-audit receiver and its fixtures (crates/lys-identity, crates/lys-identity-server, tests/identity_contract are all absent today).
- A fork-owned brief written in ablative-io/rauthy for the 21-entry wall, carried by its own card, reviewed by Waffles, built and gated on the ablative branch.
- A defined fork gate (legs and venue) for ablative-io/rauthy. The upstream workflow uses the rauthy-builder image, just build-wasm and a frontend build, and the fork has none of its own yet.
- Waffles' review of DIRECTORY-004 before dispatch (blocked_by).
- Test provider registrations for Google and GitHub, holding no production credentials.
- The Argus/venue gate path (Heimdall) working for gate submission.

### The risks

- The ID001_LINK_* grep can pass on files under tests/identity_links/ that the fork's virtual workspace never compiles, so the pin could name tests that never ran.
- If PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md is written after the receiver, it may record whatever the receiver does instead of acting as an independent contract (the 'test that only agrees with itself' failure CLAUDE.md warns about).
- An upstream release carrying #1696/#1728 could appear mid-row, forcing an IDENTITY-002/RM-003 rebase under the linking commits and moving the pin twice.
- IDENTITY-001-UPSTREAM-AUTH-STATE applies to the v0.36.2 base. A development demonstration could be mistaken for clearance for real sign-in.
- The fork's migration numbers V27/32 are correct only for v0.36.2. A rebase onto a later release may take those numbers.
- Link-audit acknowledgement depends on the receiver's receipt format. A format change after the pin lands breaks ID001_LINK_AUDIT.
- The card may sit unstartable indefinitely, because both blockers (fork-owned brief, DIRECTORY-002/003) are outside it and nothing tracks the fork brief.

### Still open

- Which document is the reviewed link-audit contract the DIRECTORY-003 receiver is built against? Is it DIRECTORY-004 R2's PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md, written after the receiver it describes, or something DIRECTORY-003 writes first that R2 then only confirms? The sentence of the words it stands on: "R2 writes the provider-link contract and the links report.". Why only the lead can settle it: The two briefs point at each other. DIRECTORY-003 R4 (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json:115) builds the receiver 'against the reviewed typed contract and fixtures before DIRECTORY-004 needs it'. DIRECTORY-004 R2 creates docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md and accepts it when 'the DIRECTORY-003 receiver's fixtures match it'. The answer decides whether R2 authors the contract or records one already built, and so what the receiver's reviewers see first.
- Which card, on which board, carries the fork-owned brief and its build in ablative-io/rauthy? This card's R1 can only land a pin to a commit that brief has gated, and no such brief or commit exists. The sentence of the words it stands on: "R1 moves the pin to the gated fork commit that links two providers (Google and GitHub) to one person, with a collision refused rather than merged.". Why only the lead can settle it: Tom's rule 1 says every carded row goes through the aion chain, and rule 5 says inputs name a repository and a commit. The linking code lives in a different repository (the ablative branch is at dd61ac3, ahead_by 0). DIRECTORY-004 blocked_by names a fork-owned brief that 'does not yet exist', owned by Chippy with Waffles reviewing. If no card carries it, this card cannot start.
- Should the fork's ID001_LINK_* tests sit in a compiled crate (so they run under the fork gate) rather than at the root-level tests/identity_links/ the wall names? If so, will the lead approve that wall revision? The sentence of the words it stands on: "Keep its boundaries and verification as written, and change nothing the method (scripts/design/validate.py, check-coverage.py, render-cluster.py, run by scripts/design/gate.sh) does not require.". Why only the lead can settle it: At the pinned commit the fork's root Cargo.toml is a virtual workspace with members = ["src/*"] and has no tests/ directory, so cargo would not compile or run files under tests/identity_links/. DIRECTORY-004's verification is a grep ('rg -n ... vendor/rauthy/tests/identity_links finds each identifier in a test'), which passes on files that never run. Under CN9, moving the wall needs an approved brief revision, and the words say to keep the verification as written.

### The units beyond the first

- Fork-owned brief and build: link two providers to one person in ablative-io/rauthy — It lives in a different repository with its own 21-entry wall, owner and gate, and this card's R1 can only pin its gated commit.
- ID001_LINK_LIVE: install the gated fork and demonstrate two linked providers to Tom — A person performs it after the row lands (CN5/CN6). It is never a loop acceptance, and it unblocks DIRECTORY-005.
- RM-003 / IDENTITY-002: rebase the fork onto the next hardened upstream release — A separately gated row whose acceptance re-proves DIRECTORY-004's provider-link behaviour on the rebased base.

### The smallest complete shape

One unit, whole: once DIRECTORY-002 and DIRECTORY-003 have landed and a fork commit on ablative has passed its gate, one lys PR moves vendor/rauthy to that commit and creates PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md and reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md. The six cargo gates and scripts/design/gate.sh pass. DIRECTORY-004 itself is carried unchanged. After landing comes the ID001_LINK_LIVE hold point for Tom. Neither half stands alone: the report names the pinned commit and its counted legs.

## The roadmap row

- **RM-020** — Link two upstream providers to one Rauthy person (feature, idea)
- Summary: The lys side of IDENTITY-001 revision 5 row 03, carried as DIRECTORY-004: move the vendor/rauthy pin to the gated commit on the fork's ablative branch that links Google and GitHub to one Rauthy person and refuses a collision rather than merging it (R1), and write the fork-side record of the receiver's link-audit contract and the row's links report (R2). R1 waits on a gated fork commit from the fork's own card; R2 waits on DIRECTORY-003's receiver and contract. The row ends in the ID001_LINK_LIVE demonstration, which holds DIRECTORY-005.
- Asked by: tom on 2026-09-27T10:27:00+10:00
- Context: The card on the Lys board that carries DIRECTORY-004; its twin PLMigKDB on board 2 was archived into it. Surveyed on lys main 7b53625: the ablative branch of ablative-io/rauthy is still at dd61ac3 (v0.36.2) with no linking commit, the fork's workspace compiles only members under src/, and DIRECTORY-002 and DIRECTORY-003 are not built. The lead for the identity line answered three survey questions: the typed link-audit contract and its fixtures are authored in lys by the DIRECTORY-003 receiver and R2's PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md records it, with DIRECTORY-003's landing as R2's precondition; no card carries the fork-owned brief yet, so R1 names the fork board's card as its blocker and a gated ablative commit found by git ls-remote as its precondition; and the ID001_LINK_* tests move from the root tests/identity_links/ into a compiled crate under src/, verified by rg together with the fork gate's cargo test log, a wall revision approved under CN9.
- Quote: The brief for this card already stands in the cluster: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-004.json and DIRECTORY-004.md, "Link two upstream providers to one Rauthy person", Row 03 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5, landed with lys PR 6. This card is the one that carries it; its twin PLMigKDB on board 2 was archived into this card. Read DIRECTORY-004 in full and carry it as this card's brief. Keep its two requirements exactly. R1 moves the pin to the gated fork commit that links two providers (Google and GitHub) to one person, with a collision refused rather than merged. R2 writes the provider-link contract and the links report. Keep its boundaries and verification as written, and change nothing the method (scripts/design/validate.py, check-coverage.py, render-cluster.py, run by scripts/design/gate.sh) does not require.

Facts the brief already settles, which the survey must not reopen, follow. The link lives in the maintained Rauthy fork (ADR-009), never in an upstream contribution. This row is built after DIRECTORY-003 (the directory contract and its link-audit receiver, Row 04) and after DIRECTORY-002 (the install). Every link is recorded through that receiver. The row ends in a live demonstration to Tom (ID001_LINK_LIVE), and a venue test or a screenshot does not replace it. Test identities only; no production key; Tom's acts stay Tom's.

If the survey finds a sentence of DIRECTORY-004 open or contradicted by the repository as it stands, quote that sentence as a question for the lead rather than rewriting the brief around it.
- Cluster: directory; briefs: DIRECTORY-004
- Notes: Id under the ruling that a brief's ids are the next after main's highest and every open brief branch's: RM-019 is the highest on brief/home/06103633 at 7b53625, so this row is RM-020. The brief is DIRECTORY-004, already on main and carried by this card, amended in place with the lead's three answers; this row owns it, so RM-001's links.briefs no longer names it (one row owns a brief), and RM-001 keeps DIRECTORY-001, 002, 003 and 005. Further units, not written: Fork-owned brief and build: link two providers to one person in ablative-io/rauthy; ID001_LINK_LIVE: install the gated fork and demonstrate two linked providers to Tom; RM-003 / IDENTITY-002: rebase the fork onto the next hardened upstream release.

## The design

---
type: design
cluster: directory
title: The standalone identity directory, with every grant rooted in a person
---

# The standalone identity directory, with every grant rooted in a person

> **Cluster:** directory

## Intention

An operator installs the identity product without Cambium or Manifold, signs in, links Google and GitHub to one person, registers an agent under a responsible person, and inspects the signed history of every identity change. Cambium later uses this issuer, keeping its participant ids (rows 06 and 07); that direction is recorded here while rows 06 and 07 stay the non-goal recorded below, and this sentence promises neither row.

## Problem

IDENTITY-001 revision 5 is the reviewed plan for this, in the older row form, and it predates Tom's ruling of 22 September 17:15 that every grant is pegged to a human authority, his PostgreSQL ruling of 23 September 14:14, and the working lifecycle states. Its row 02 installs SpiceDB without saying what it enforces. It cannot be dispatched to the design-system loop as it stands.

## Solution

Carry IDENTITY-001's open rows (02, 04, 03, 05) into design-system briefs in this cluster, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, revised for the grant ruling (ADR-003), the PostgreSQL ruling (ADR-005) and the working lifecycle states (ADR-011, proposed), with the fork (ADR-009) and the product accents (ADR-010) in the project ledger and every decision still open for Tom marked open. The IDENTITY-001 files stay as they are, as the record of revision 5.

## Principles

- **P1** — An enduring identity ID is stable through provider additions, key rotation and later sessions; issuer plus subject identifies an external login; email and display name never establish identity equivalence.
- **P2** — Everything is pegged to a human authority: the responsible person's permissions are the ceiling and an agent holds an explicit subset; exercising an act and delegating it are separate grants; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it.
- **P3** — A person or agent may be registered before any session exists; registration creates no running state and issues no Rauthy login, runtime credential or capability certificate.
- **P4** — One signed committed directory event is both the identity change and its audit record; never a database change followed by a best-effort log append.
- **P5** — No success before durable evidence; an uncertain append is reconciled before its projection answers as current, and pending or refused outcomes stay visible until resolved.
- **P6** — A future execution or fork ID refers to its enduring identity and, for a fork, its parent execution; step 1 reserves that distinction in the contract and implements neither session history nor launch.
- **P7** — An audit receipt carries a version, a stable operation ID, the actor, the affected identity, the operation, a payload commitment and the resulting log coordinate or checkpoint; secrets and whole context objects are excluded, and its exact signed encoding is reviewed before use.
- **P8** — The service attests the authenticated human actor and their authentication provenance; it never claims a person signed bytes with a key they do not hold, and a registration records the person who made it, never an invented agent signature.
- **P9** — The initial directory administrator is bootstrapped by an explicitly configured issuer and subject, never by email or first visitor; every other mutation caller is refused in step 1.

## Decisions

- ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
- ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
- ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL, possibly on a network device — PostgreSQL is used for the identity product's database. It may be set up on one of the network devices rather than on Tom's Mac.
- ADR-007 — The product starts an agent by giving its start command, never by running it — The product is not an execution engine. For the first release an agent's file gives the command that starts it on a chosen machine: the command carries the agent's identity and its handles, never a credential's value, and it is rendered from the agent's kept launch record. A started agent reports back, so the sessions screen shows what is running. A terminal inside the product, sandboxes, virtual machines and containers are later runtimes that plug in, and none is built into this product.
- ADR-008 — An agent's file shows its lys certificate — An agent's file shows its lys certificate once one is issued: what it claims, who signed it, when it was issued and when it expires, with the signed receipts of the changes made to it. An agent registered before any key or proof of possession was supplied shows its certificate as not issued, never a placeholder.
- ADR-009 — People sign in through a maintained Rauthy fork of our own — Rauthy authenticates people, and its one-provider-per-user limit is changed in a fork we maintain, ablative-io/rauthy, not contributed upstream as a prerequisite. The maintained branch is ablative, created from upstream v0.36.2 commit dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; the fork's main stays an untouched upstream mirror; lys pins an exact commit of ablative as the submodule vendor/rauthy. Upgrades rebase ablative onto upstream release tags only, each in its own gated row; no cherry-picks and no reset of main.
- ADR-010 — Every product shares one design and keeps its own accent; the identity product's is orange — The identity screens follow Aion's structure, typography, spacing and interaction, and Rauthy's client themes take the same colours, with no build dependency on Cambium or Aion. Each product keeps its own accent within the estate colour family: Cambium green, Aion blue and black, Argus light blue, Haematite mustard. The identity product's accent is orange (accent #D4975A, deep #A86B2E, wash #3D2A17 in the estate colour tokens), set apart from Manifold's copper. No product is silently made Aion-blue, and purple is not used.
- ADR-011 — An identity is registered, active, suspended or retired — An identity is in one of four states: registered (exists in the directory, no grants, no credential handle, may not act), active (may act within its grants), suspended (kept whole, grants kept but not effective) and retired (permanent, history kept, never reactivated; a new identity is made instead). Register, activate, suspend, reinstate and retire are the only transitions, each one signed audit record naming the authenticated actor and their provenance, the identity, from, to, when and reason. Having a grant or a credential is a fact beside the state, not a state. A person is registered by first sign-in; an agent is registered by a signed-in person, who carries it as its responsible person for life and may cause every transition of their own agents.

## Goals

- Every open row of IDENTITY-001 (02, 04, 03, 05) exists as a valid design-system brief in this cluster, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in its dependency order, every ID001 acceptance identifier kept.
- The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement of the row that owns it, with acceptance criteria; where the sources do not settle the row, it is recorded open for Tom in DIRECTORY-003 with its criteria drafted.
- Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open and decided nowhere in this cluster.
- The two live demonstrations to Tom, ID001_LINK_LIVE and ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE, stay hold points a loop completion never replaces (CN6).
- DIRECTORY-006 makes the grant/refusal journey enforceable and binds its acceptance to the reviewed mock-up, without rewriting the historical IDENTITY-001 record.

## Non-Goals

- Rows 06 (connect Cambium) and 07 (gate, install and demonstrate the release) — They change the Cambium repository and depend on IDENTITY-002, the upstream release rebase; they need a Cambium cluster or an agreed cross-repository arrangement first.
- Row 03's changes inside the Rauthy fork — The fork is its own repository under vendor/rauthy; a row whose files live there needs its own brief in the fork, which does not yet exist and blocks DIRECTORY-004. DIRECTORY-004 names the fork files as work with their owner, not as files of this repository.
- The grant representation: how one grant records who may exercise it, whether it may be passed on (person, agent or nobody), what it derives from, and whether it can be bounded. OPEN for Tom. — The statement leaves the exact delegation schema unsettled (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:21; ADR-003); AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23's questions (docs/design/identity/AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md:17-23) are inputs to it, not answers.
- Suspension semantics: whether suspending a person also ends their sign-in session at Rauthy or only makes our checks refuse, and what else stops with a suspended identity. OPEN for Tom. — The lifecycle document asks it of the room (docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:99-100, docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:104-105) and its states are only proposed (ADR-011); two systems, one decision.
- The name of the identity service. OPEN for Tom. — The statement lists it as not decided (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:192); no crate or directory name selects it.
- Which anchor the first agents pin to: our hosted anchor, a self-hosted one, or both. OPEN for Tom. — Lys leaves it as a product decision and so does the statement (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:193).
- A nightly Rauthy base versus waiting for an upstream release carrying #1696 and #1728. OPEN for Tom. — Waffles' ruling of 15:36:25: if upstream has published no such release by the row 05 showing, Tom decides (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:18; docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:177); rows 02 to 05 run on v0.36.2 meanwhile.
- Road step 2 onward: capability certificates, arbitrary grants and their enforcement, session launch and stop, credential handles, memory, context assembly, lanterns and anchoring in production — Revision 5 keeps them out of step 1 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:29-30); ADR-007 (the start command) and ADR-008 (the certificate on an agent's file) govern what the step-1 screens do not present as working.
- The examples in AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23 (abilities with an assignment or project, seat provisioning within a budget, private and shared notes) — Tom gave them as not yet decided (docs/design/identity/AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md:11-15); they are never turned into requirements.
- A production Cambium auth cutover, and any upstream Rauthy contribution as a prerequisite — Revision 5 forbids both before scratch acceptance, review and Gypsy's coordinated install (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:31).
- A shared design-system package extracted for every product — Tom left it as a thing to look at, not a row (ADR-010).

## Inventory

- `docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json` — IDENTITY-001 revision 5, the reviewed plan these briefs carry forward: rows, walls, acceptance identifiers (ID001_*), estimates, authority and review decisions. Read, never changed.
- `docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.md` — its rendered twin
- `docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md` — the authority, including 'Everything is pegged to a human authority (Tom, 17:15 to 17:16)'
- `docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md` — the working lifecycle states: registered, active, suspended, retired
- `docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md` — provisioning an agent under a human, the seven-step path
- `docs/design/identity/AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md` — Tom's 23 September ruling: 'If a human can do it through the UI, then I want an agent to be able to do it'; whether an agent may is a permission question. Input to the directory and permission rows. Its examples are recorded as undecided and are never turned into requirements.
- `docs/design/identity/RAUTHY-BASELINE.md` — the fork baseline: pin, maintenance owner, the IDENTITY-001-UPSTREAM-AUTH-STATE blocker; read, never changed
- `docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md` — Accepted mock-up behaviour map; DIRECTORY-006 maps You/delegation/access requirements and does not claim mock-up sample policy is authoritative.
- `vendor/rauthy` — the maintained Rauthy fork (ADR-009), the git submodule pinned at dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662, the upstream v0.36.2 commit the ablative branch was created from; DIRECTORY-004 moves the pin (structure row); read here, never changed by a document row
- `crates/lys` — the lys CLI crate: Cargo.toml, src/main.rs, src/cli.rs and src/commands/ (attest, ca, key, log, inspect, files); DIRECTORY-002 adds src/identity/ and the identity subcommand to it (structure rows)
- `docs/design/decisions.json` — the project decision ledger, ADR-001 to ADR-018 at main, holding the decisions this cluster cites (ADR-003, ADR-004, ADR-005, ADR-007 to ADR-011); DIRECTORY-001 recorded that it gained the identity decisions (structure row); read here, never changed by a document row

## Constraints

- **CN1** — Documents only: nothing outside docs/design/directory/ and docs/design/decisions.json is created or modified; the IDENTITY-001 files are not changed.
- **CN2** — Development isolation: rows 02 to 05 use only disposable test identities and test provider registrations; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration.
- **CN3** — Every path written in a document of this cluster is relative to the repository root, whatever directory a session starts in; a command runs from its own tree and spells its paths from there.
- **CN4** — No structure row or files entry carries a root token; a file in another repository is named in a requirement's spec with its owner.
- **CN5** — A live demonstration to Tom is never an acceptance criterion of a loop requirement; it is a verification step a person performs after the row lands.
- **CN6** — The live demonstrations ID001_LINK_LIVE (after row 03) and ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE (after row 05) are mandatory operator hold points: the brief that follows each is blocked by it until Tom's demonstration receipt is recorded; a loop completion never stands in for one.
- **CN7** — Revision 5's ceiling stands: 48 focused implementer hours for IDENTITY-001 (row 01 1.5, closed; 02 8; 04 10; 03 10; 05 6; 06 4; 07 5; total 44.5, contingency 3.5), with IDENTITY-002's 4 hours outside it. An overrun is reported as soon as it is known, and Waffles takes any ceiling change to Tom (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:24).
- **CN8** — One implementer, one row in implementation and one gate invocation at a time in this lane; release builds, checks and tests run through the gate workflow at the venue, and a development exception never bypasses it (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:25-27, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:135).
- **CN9** — A row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and the reviewer approves a brief revision before that file is edited; a directory wall for a wholly new module allows only its named responsibility and needs an exact file manifest reviewed before its row starts (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:28).
- **CN10** — Rows 02 to 05 run on Rauthy v0.36.2 under Waffles' ruling of 15:36:25; each development install checks current releases and advisories and records the accepted exception; IDENTITY-001-UPSTREAM-AUTH-STATE binds real sign-in and install, rows 06 and 07 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:18, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:46).
- **CN11** — Step 1 is directory records, sign-in and the minimum signed identity audit. SpiceDB is installed and checked in row 02 and enforces nothing in step 1; live capability policy and its enforcement are step 2's, and running SpiceDB is not permission enforcement (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:29-30).
- **CN12** — DIRECTORY-006 is implementation work after the frozen planning task: its source paths are only executable after the DIRECTORY-002/003 foundations are implemented and their integration manifests are reconciled. R6 also waits for the standalone surface foundation. Do not dispatch from a schema-valid but dependency-blocked brief.

# DIRECTORY-001: Revise the identity directory plan for human-rooted grants, as design-system briefs

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
> - ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
> - ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL, possibly on a network device — PostgreSQL is used for the identity product's database. It may be set up on one of the network devices rather than on Tom's Mac.
> **Checklist:**
> - C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
> - C2 — The project decision ledger holds the identity decisions with their authority and quote: the maintained Rauthy fork, one PostgreSQL service and database (ADR-005, already recorded), the product accents, and the lifecycle states as working team decisions marked proposed.
> - C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task.
> - C4 — The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement with acceptance criteria in the row that owns it, and row 02 states what SpiceDB enforces in step 1 and what it does not.
> - C5 — Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open: the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor, and nightly versus waiting for the upstream release.
> - C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.
> **Stories:**
> - S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.
> - S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

## Purpose

Rewrite the identity plan so every grant traces back to a person (Tom, 22 September 17:15), with the PostgreSQL decision and the four lifecycle states in, as design-system briefs the loop can build. Documents only; comes before any code.

## Task

Read IDENTITY-001.json revision 5 in full, the statement's section 'Everything is pegged to a human authority', LIFECYCLE-STATES, PROVISIONING, AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23 (its examples are undecided and are not requirements), and ADR-005 in docs/design/decisions.json, which already records Tom's PostgreSQL ruling. Add the identity decisions to docs/design/decisions.json, complete this cluster's design, checklist and stories, and write DIRECTORY-002 (row 02, 8 hours), DIRECTORY-003 (row 04, 10 hours), DIRECTORY-004 (row 03, 10 hours) and DIRECTORY-005 (row 05, 6 hours), each depending on the one before, revision 5's 48-hour ceiling kept and any re-estimate stated. Carry every ID001 acceptance identifier forward unchanged. Every path in a document of this cluster is relative to the repository root, even though the session starts in docs/.

## Requirements

### R1: Record the identity decisions and complete the directory design

THE SYSTEM SHALL add to docs/design/decisions.json one ADR per identity decision named in C2 that the ledger does not already hold (ADR-005, PostgreSQL, is already there and is cited, not rewritten), each with its authority, date, decider and, where the source holds Tom's own words, the quote; a working team decision SHALL be status proposed, never decided. The directory design SHALL gain those ADR ids and SHALL keep revision 5's outcome, shared contract, constraints and non-goals, revised for the grant ruling. Each ADR's source SHALL be cited from IDENTITY-001's authority or review_decisions, the statement, or the lifecycle document; nothing is invented.

**Acceptance:**
- validate.py reports decisions.json and design.json valid.
- Every ADR added cites its source, and the lifecycle states ADR is status proposed.
- ADR-005 is unchanged and the directory design anchors to it.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/decisions.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/design.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md

**Checklist:**
- C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
- C2 — The project decision ledger holds the identity decisions with their authority and quote: the maintained Rauthy fork, one PostgreSQL service and database (ADR-005, already recorded), the product accents, and the lifecycle states as working team decisions marked proposed.

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.

#### R1 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Row 1 (validate.py reports decisions.json and design.json valid): both files were written to the decisions and design schemas. I checked keys and types against docs/design/decisions.json:146-199 and docs/design/directory/design.json with my own code, not validate.py, which the workflow runs. Row 2 (every added ADR cites its source; the lifecycle ADR is proposed): ADR-009 at docs/design/decisions.json:146 cites the statement at :191 and IDENTITY-001 at :10, :17 and :35. ADR-010 at :164 cites the statement at :194 and IDENTITY-001 at :14-15 and :43-44. ADR-011 at :182 cites LIFECYCLE-STATES at :17-44 and :71-95 and has "status": "proposed" (:184). Row 3 (ADR-005 unchanged, design anchors to it): a comparison against HEAD shows the ADR-001 to ADR-008 prefix is identical. ADR-005 stays in docs/design/directory/design.json 'decisions' (:45). Revision 5's content is kept, revised for the grant ruling: the outcome is the intention, the shared contract is P1 to P9 (:7-44), the constraints are CN1 to CN11 (:444) and the non-goals start at :61.
- Deviation: (none)
- Files changed:
  - modified: `docs/design/decisions.json` — 'updated' is now 2026-09-24. Three ADRs added: ADR-009 (the maintained Rauthy fork, decided, Tom with Waffles' branch rule, with Tom's quote), ADR-010 (shared design with each product keeping its own accent, identity orange, decided, Tom's 15:18 quote) and ADR-011 (registered/active/suspended/retired, status proposed, Archie for the working team). Each cites its sources; ADR-001 to ADR-008 are byte-identical.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/design.json` — Adds principles P6 to P9 from revision 5's shared contract and review decisions, with P3 revised. Decisions now ADR-003, 004, 005, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011. Goals, non-goals (five marked OPEN for Tom), constraints CN7 to CN11 from revision 5's ceiling, a structure row for every listed path, and the RAUTHY-BASELINE inventory entry.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md` — Markdown rendered from design.json with the method's render_design.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling. — Outcome, principles P1 to P9, CN7 to CN11 and the revised non-goals are in docs/design/directory/design.json.
  - [x] C2 — The project decision ledger holds the identity decisions with their authority and quote: the maintained Rauthy fork, one PostgreSQL service and database (ADR-005, already recorded), the product accents, and the lifecycle states as working team decisions marked proposed. — Fork (ADR-009), PostgreSQL (ADR-005, cited), accents (ADR-010) and lifecycle states (ADR-011, proposed).
- Story delivery:
  - [x] S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it. — P2 and ADR-003 anchor the design. Every agent is registered under its responsible person (DIRECTORY-003 R1).

**Review (recorded):**

- Alignment: aligned
- Acceptance verdicts:
  - [x] validate.py reports decisions.json and design.json valid. — From docs/: validate.py docs/design/decisions.json -> 'design/decisions.json: OK [decisions.schema.json] All 1 document(s) valid.' (exit 0); validate.py docs/design/directory -> 'design/directory/design.json: OK [design.schema.json]', all 8 valid (exit 0).
  - [x] Every ADR added cites its source, and the lifecycle states ADR is status proposed. — docs/design/decisions.json ADR-009 context cites STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:191 and IDENTITY-001.json:10, :17, :35, all verified; the quote matches STATEMENT:191 verbatim. ADR-010 cites STATEMENT:194 and IDENTITY-001.json:14-15, :43-44; its hex values match IDENTITY-001.json:44; its quote matches STATEMENT:194 verbatim. ADR-011 cites LIFECYCLE-STATES:1-8, :17-44, :71-95, :101-103, with status 'proposed' and decided_by 'Archie ... not ruled by Tom'.
  - [x] ADR-005 is unchanged and the directory design anchors to it. — A Python comparison of HEAD:docs/design/decisions.json decisions[] against the working tree's first 8 entries -> 'prefix same True'. design.json decisions list contains ADR-005 (DESIGN.md Decisions section).

### R2: Carry rows 02, 04, 03 and 05 into design-system briefs

THE SYSTEM SHALL write DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005 from revision 5's rows 02, 04, 03 and 05, each valid against the brief schema: its work as requirements, its wall as files (a file in the Rauthy fork, which is its own repository under vendor/rauthy, is named in the spec with its owner and is not listed in files), its acceptance as criteria keeping every ID001 identifier, its dependencies as depends_on, its estimate in its task. A live demonstration to Tom SHALL be a verification step, never an acceptance criterion. Every path a row brief lists SHALL gain a structure row in design.json. DIRECTORY-004 (row 03) SHALL carry in blocked_by the fork-owned brief that does not yet exist, named as such, so it is never an executable brief with an empty wall. DIRECTORY-005 SHALL carry in blocked_by the ID001_LINK_LIVE demonstration to Tom, and the design's hold point for ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE SHALL be kept, per CN6.

**Acceptance:**
- DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005 exist and validate.py reports each valid.
- Each ID001 acceptance identifier of rows 02, 04, 03 and 05 appears in its brief.
- depends_on runs DIRECTORY-002, then 003, then 004, then 005, matching revision 5's order 02, 04, 03, 05.
- No acceptance criterion requires a live demonstration; each row's demonstration appears under verification.
- check-coverage.py reports every listed path present in the structure.
- DIRECTORY-004's blocked_by names the missing fork-owned brief.
- DIRECTORY-005's blocked_by names the ID001_LINK_LIVE demonstration.

**Files:**
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.md
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.md
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-004.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-004.md
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md
- modify: docs/design/directory/design.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md

**Checklist:**
- C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

#### R2 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Row 1 (the four briefs exist and are valid): all four follow brief.schema.json's required keys, and my own key check passed. Row 2 (every ID001 identifier kept): a script compared revision 5's acceptance for each row with the briefs and found nothing missing. Row 02 has DEPLOY, DEPLOY_REFUSAL, THEME, SHARED_DB and PIN_CLONE. Row 04 has DIRECTORY, AUDIT_FAULTS, ADMIN, RECEIPT and RECEIVER. Row 03 has LINK_PAIR, LINK_REFUSAL, LINK_MIGRATION, LINK_AUDIT and LINK_LIVE. Row 05 has STANDALONE, SCREEN_REFUSAL and DIRECTORY_LIVE. Row 3 (dependency order): depends_on at line 5 of each brief is DIRECTORY-001 for 002, then 002, 003 and 004 in turn. Row 4 (no live demonstration in acceptance): no acceptance string names a demonstration. ID001_LINK_LIVE and ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE are the last verification entries of DIRECTORY-004 and DIRECTORY-005. Row 5 (every listed path in the structure): I checked each path, directory prefixes included, against docs/design/directory/design.json:107 onward, with none missing. Row 6: DIRECTORY-004.json:8 blocked_by names 'The fork-owned brief for row 03's Rauthy changes, which does not yet exist'. Row 7: DIRECTORY-005.json:8 blocked_by starts with 'ID001_LINK_LIVE: Tom's live demonstration of row 03'. The ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE hold point is kept in CN6 (design.json:466), a design goal, and DIRECTORY-005's verification. Estimates are 8, 10, 10 and 6 hours with no re-estimate, stated in each task, and CN7 keeps the 48-hour ceiling.
- Deviation: Four judgement calls. (1) DIRECTORY-002 depends_on DIRECTORY-001, because row 01 is IDENTITY-001's and is already accepted; that acceptance is stated in the task. (2) Revision 5's report names under docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-*.md are kept as each row's wall, so they carry forward unchanged. (3) DIRECTORY-003 and DIRECTORY-005 carry in blocked_by the exact file manifest that revision 5 (IDENTITY-001.json:28) requires before a wholly new module's row starts. (4) Revision 5's 'edit main in the main Mac checkout, no worktree' venue rule is not carried as a constraint, because this loop now runs in clones. CN8 keeps the part that still binds: one implementer, one row and one gate at a time, with the gate workflow never bypassed.

**Review (recorded):**

- Alignment: fixed
- Acceptance verdicts:
  - [x] DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005 exist and validate.py reports each valid. — validate.py docs/design/directory: DIRECTORY-002.json to DIRECTORY-005.json each 'OK [brief.schema.json]', exit 0 (re-run after the harden edit).
  - [x] Each ID001 acceptance identifier of rows 02, 04, 03 and 05 appears in its brief. — Running grep -o 'ID001_[A-Z_]*' on each brief gives 002: DEPLOY, DEPLOY_REFUSAL, PIN_CLONE, SHARED_DB, THEME; 003: ADMIN, AUDIT_FAULTS, DIRECTORY, RECEIPT, RECEIVER; 004: LINK_PAIR, LINK_REFUSAL, LINK_MIGRATION, LINK_AUDIT, LINK_LIVE; 005: STANDALONE, SCREEN_REFUSAL, DIRECTORY_LIVE. These equal IDENTITY-001 rows 02/04/03/05 acceptance, and the acceptance texts are verbatim. CAMBIUM_LINK, GOOGLE_SEPARATE and PKCE belong to rows 06 and 07, which are out of scope.
  - [x] depends_on runs DIRECTORY-002, then 003, then 004, then 005, matching revision 5's order 02, 04, 03, 05. — check-coverage.py 'Brief dependencies': 002 depends on 001, 003 on 002, 004 on 003, 005 on 004. 003 is row 04, 004 is row 03 and 005 is row 05, matching revision 5's order 02, 04, 03, 05.
  - [x] No acceptance criterion requires a live demonstration; each row's demonstration appears under verification. — The ID001_LINK_LIVE text appears only in DIRECTORY-004 verification[3] and DIRECTORY-005 blocked_by[0].

- Checklist verified: C3
- Stories verified: S2
- Issues:
  - DIRECTORY-003 R1 spec contradicted itself. It said 'a person is registered by first sign-in' and also 'in step 1 the only caller that may register is the configured administrator'. Under P9 and IDENTITY-001.json:38 every non-admin mutation is refused in step 1, so the first clause would lead an implementer to break ID001_ADMIN.
- Fixes:
  - docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json R1 spec: self-registration by first sign-in is now attributed to ADR-011's proposal. The spec states that in step 1 the only caller that may register a person or an agent is the configured administrator (P9, IDENTITY-001.json:38), and that a first sign-in registers nobody. DIRECTORY-003.md was re-rendered with render-cluster.py.

### R3: Put the grant path and the enforcement boundary in the row that owns them

THE SYSTEM SHALL make the grant path named in C4 a requirement, with acceptance criteria, in the row brief the sources place it in, and SHALL state in DIRECTORY-002 what SpiceDB enforces in step 1 and what it does not. Where the sources do not settle which row owns the grant path, the brief SHALL record that as open for Tom and SHALL NOT pick one.

**Acceptance:**
- The grant path appears as one requirement with criteria for allowed-before-revoke and refused-after-revoke, or is recorded as open with the question stated.
- DIRECTORY-002 states SpiceDB's step-1 role in one sentence.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json

**Checklist:**
- C4 — The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement with acceptance criteria in the row that owns it, and row 02 states what SpiceDB enforces in step 1 and what it does not.

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.

#### R3 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Row 1 (grant path as a requirement, or open with the question stated): the sources conflict. Revision 5 keeps arbitrary grants and enforcement in step 2 (IDENTITY-001.json:29-30). Chippy's 17:08 first screen (STATEMENT:183) and PROVISIONING:23-24 put the path in 'steps 1 and 2' without naming a row. So DIRECTORY-003.json:138 (R5 spec) records it as OPEN for Tom and does not pick one, as the spec requires. It asks whether the path lands in DIRECTORY-003, a new row before DIRECTORY-005, or step 2's first brief. It drafts allowed-before-revoke (a), refused-after-revoke (b), refused-after-suspend (c) and audit (d), so nothing is lost. An R5 acceptance criterion requires it to still be open at review. Row 2 (DIRECTORY-002 states SpiceDB's step-1 role in one sentence): DIRECTORY-002.json:139 opens with that sentence: installed, migrated, backed up and health-checked, enforcing nothing, with no decision asked and no grant written, and enforcement left to step 2. It then states what SpiceDB does not do. R4's acceptance requires the sentence verbatim in deploy/identity/README.md.
- Deviation: (none)
- Files changed:
  - created: `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.json` — R4 states SpiceDB's step-1 role in one sentence and forbids any check or grant write.
  - created: `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json` — R5 records the grant path's owning row as OPEN for Tom. It states the question and drafts criteria (a) to (d) for whichever row Tom places it in.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C4 — The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement with acceptance criteria in the row that owns it, and row 02 states what SpiceDB enforces in step 1 and what it does not. — Uses the brief's allowed alternative: the grant path's row is recorded open with the question and criteria stated, and row 02 states SpiceDB's step-1 role.
- Story delivery:
  - [x] S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it. — The responsible person is recorded on every agent, and the grant path's criteria are drafted for the row Tom chooses.

**Review (recorded):**

- Alignment: aligned
- Acceptance verdicts:
  - [x] The grant path appears as one requirement with criteria for allowed-before-revoke and refused-after-revoke, or is recorded as open with the question stated. — DIRECTORY-003.json R5 spec records 'OPEN for Tom, not decided here: which row owns the grant path'. It states the question (DIRECTORY-003, a new row before DIRECTORY-005, or step 2's first brief) and the conflicting sources: IDENTITY-001.json:29-30 against STATEMENT:183 and PROVISIONING:23-24, which I verified. It drafts criteria (a) allowed before revoke, (b) refused after revoke, (c) refused after suspend and (d) audit.
  - [x] DIRECTORY-002 states SpiceDB's step-1 role in one sentence. — DIRECTORY-002.json R4 spec opens with a single sentence: 'in step 1 SpiceDB is installed, migrated, backed up and health-checked against the shared PostgreSQL database, and it enforces nothing, because no component asks it for a permission decision or writes a grant to it, and live capability policy and its enforcement stay with road step 2'. Its acceptance requires that sentence word for word in deploy/identity/README.md.

### R4: Mark the open decisions open and keep the cluster covered

THE SYSTEM SHALL record each open decision named in C5 in the design's non-goals or the owning brief as open for Tom, deciding none of them, and SHALL add the rows' checklist items and stories so that every one is named by a row brief and the rendered markdown matches the JSON.

**Acceptance:**
- Each open decision in C5 appears once, marked open.
- check-coverage.py exits 0.
- render-cluster.py leaves the rendered markdown unchanged after the commit.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/checklist.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/CHECKLIST.md
- modify: docs/design/directory/stories.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/USER-STORIES.md

**Checklist:**
- C5 — Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open: the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor, and nightly versus waiting for the upstream release.
- C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

#### R4 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Row 1 (each C5 open decision appears once, marked open): docs/design/directory/design.json non_goals (:61) has one entry each, marked 'OPEN for Tom', for the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor, and nightly versus waiting. The rendered DESIGN.md has them at lines 57-61, and the phrase occurs nowhere else in the cluster except DIRECTORY-003's grant-path question, which is not a C5 item. Row 2 (check-coverage.py exits 0): my own check found every C1 to C20 and S1 to S7 named by a brief and each brief-level array equal to the union of its requirements. Every design_anchor exists in decisions.json, every file path is in the structure and there are no cycles. I did not run check-coverage.py. Row 3 (render leaves the markdown unchanged): every .md was produced by the method's own render_design, render_checklist, render_stories and render_brief functions from the final JSON. DIRECTORY-001.md was re-rendered byte-identical, so the render leg should find no change.
- Deviation: To produce the markdown I imported render-cluster.py's and render-brief.py's functions in a Python snippet instead of hand-writing it. I did not invoke the render-cluster.py command itself, which is the gate leg.
- Files changed:
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/checklist.json` — Four row sections with C7 to C20, each named by a row brief. C1 to C6 are unchanged.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/CHECKLIST.md` — Rendered.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/stories.json` — S4 and S5 added under Responsible person, plus two new personas, Operator (S3, S6) and Verifier (S7). S1 and S2 are unchanged.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/USER-STORIES.md` — Rendered.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C5 — Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open: the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor, and nightly versus waiting for the upstream release. — Five non-goals, each marked OPEN for Tom once. None is decided.
  - [x] C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean. — Markdown was rendered by the method's functions from the final JSON, and my own coverage check is clean. The gate legs will confirm this.
- Story delivery:
  - [x] S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria. — Every checklist item and story is named by a row brief for review.

**Review (recorded):**

- Alignment: aligned
- Acceptance verdicts:
  - [x] Each open decision in C5 appears once, marked open. — design.json non_goals lines 71, 75, 79, 83 and 87 carry one 'OPEN for Tom' entry each for the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor and nightly versus waiting (DESIGN.md:57-61). A grep across the cluster JSON finds no other open-marked record of them; DIRECTORY-003's OPEN is the grant-path row, which is not a C5 item, and DIRECTORY-001's hits are the dev record.
  - [x] check-coverage.py exits 0. — From docs/: check-coverage.py docs/design/directory -> 20 items, 7 stories, 5 briefs, 'Coverage clean', exit 0. Two legal warnings: S1 and S3 are each claimed by more than one brief.
  - [x] render-cluster.py leaves the rendered markdown unchanged after the commit. — After the harden edit and one render, I took md5 of every .md in docs/design/directory and briefs, ran render-cluster.py docs/design/directory again and re-hashed: no difference ('RENDER-STABLE').

# DIRECTORY-002: Install the standalone service dependencies on one PostgreSQL database

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-001
> **Blocked by:** Waffles' review of this brief before it is dispatched (DIRECTORY-001 boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it), Waffles' re-check of revision 5's row-02 module manifest, which IDENTITY-001 records as due before row 02 source starts (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:20, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:407), The venue gate path ID001_PIN_CLONE needs, which revision 5 records as resting with Heimdall (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:17, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:407); the row's gate is not submitted until it is confirmed
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
> - ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL, possibly on a network device — PostgreSQL is used for the identity product's database. It may be set up on one of the network devices rather than on Tom's Mac.
> - ADR-009 — People sign in through a maintained Rauthy fork of our own — Rauthy authenticates people, and its one-provider-per-user limit is changed in a fork we maintain, ablative-io/rauthy, not contributed upstream as a prerequisite. The maintained branch is ablative, created from upstream v0.36.2 commit dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; the fork's main stays an untouched upstream mirror; lys pins an exact commit of ablative as the submodule vendor/rauthy. Upgrades rebase ablative onto upstream release tags only, each in its own gated row; no cherry-picks and no reset of main.
> - ADR-010 — Every product shares one design and keeps its own accent; the identity product's is orange — The identity screens follow Aion's structure, typography, spacing and interaction, and Rauthy's client themes take the same colours, with no build dependency on Cambium or Aion. Each product keeps its own accent within the estate colour family: Cambium green, Aion blue and black, Argus light blue, Haematite mustard. The identity product's accent is orange (accent #D4975A, deep #A86B2E, wash #3D2A17 in the estate colour tokens), set apart from Manifold's copper. No product is silently made Aion-blue, and purple is not used.

## Purpose

Row 02 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5: the three dependency processes of the standalone identity product (the maintained Rauthy, ADR-009; SpiceDB; one PostgreSQL service and database, ADR-005) installed for development with durable storage, the lys CLI that prepares, configures and checks them, and both Rauthy client themes (ADR-010). Revised for Tom's PostgreSQL ruling, which lets the database live on a network device so its address is configuration, and for the grant ruling (ADR-003), which makes SpiceDB's step-1 role explicit: installed and checked, enforcing nothing yet.

## Task

Carry IDENTITY-001 revision 5 row 02 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:89-167) into requirements: packaging and the development install (R1), the lys identity CLI (R2), the two client themes (R3) and SpiceDB's step-1 role (R4). Row 01, the fork and its pin, was accepted by Waffles at 15:36:25 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:18); its fresh recursive-clone proof is due at this row's venue gate (ID001_PIN_CLONE). Estimate: 8 focused implementer hours, revision 5's figure for this row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:20); no re-estimate. Revision 5's 48-hour ceiling stands (CN7); an overrun is reported as soon as it is known. Out: the directory itself (DIRECTORY-003), any grant or permission check, and real sign-in (rows 06 and 07). Every path is relative to the repository root; the estate colour tokens live in another repository and are named in R3's spec with their owner.

## Requirements

### R1: Package Rauthy, SpiceDB and one PostgreSQL database, and install them for development

THE SYSTEM SHALL package the maintained Rauthy at the pinned vendor/rauthy commit (ADR-009), SpiceDB, and one PostgreSQL service with one durable database (ADR-005) in deploy/identity/compose.yaml, with pinned supported releases and image digests in deploy/identity/versions.json, separate least-privilege roles and schema namespaces created by deploy/identity/postgres-init.sql through PostgreSQL's own init directory, explicitly configured credentials, and documented local and TLS origins in deploy/identity/config.example.toml (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:136, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:36). The database address SHALL be configuration and SHALL NOT assume Tom's Mac (ADR-005). Both migration runners and their connection search paths SHALL be verified to coexist before one-database readiness is claimed. These are three dependency processes beside the platform door; Cambium, Manifold, Argus and Aion servers are not runtime dependencies (ADR-004). THE SYSTEM SHALL define readiness, migration order, named configuration failures, stop and start, and backup and restore (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:137), documenting in deploy/identity/README.md the cache, key and config files Rauthy's internal Hiqlite cache needs rather than claiming a SQL dump alone backs up the product; no Hiqlite identity datastore is used in the installed configuration (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:36). The development instance is installed on a node the operator names (ADR-005) with test identities only; release builds, checks and tests stay on the gate workflow, and each development install checks upstream releases and advisories and records the accepted v0.36.2 exception (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:135, CN10). Results, digests and the restore outcome go to docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-deployment.md, the report name revision 5 gives this row.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_DEPLOY: from a fresh venue directory, dependencies become ready with no other Ablative service running; restart preserves issuer identity and database contents.
- ID001_DEPLOY_REFUSAL: missing secret, invalid issuer/redirect and unavailable database produce named failures, never a substitute identity or development database.
- Dependency artifact digests, versions, resolved configuration without secrets and backup/restore result are recorded in docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-deployment.md. This row does not claim the product directory exists yet.
- ID001_SHARED_DB: prove Rauthy and SpiceDB both write/reopen against the same PostgreSQL database, migrations do not collide and the service roles cannot read the other schema. Restore the database plus documented key/config/cache dependencies and repeat readiness.
- ID001_PIN_CLONE: the venue fetches the exact pushed Lys ref with recursive submodules and verifies the expected Rauthy commit on ablative without using the Mac reading copy.
- A test configures a database address other than the local host: the resolved configuration names that address, and no default local address is substituted when it is unreachable (ADR-005).

- create: crates/lys/tests/identity_support/fixtures.rs
- create: crates/lys/tests/identity_support/server.rs
- create: crates/lys/tests/identity_support/compose.rs

**Checklist:**
- C7 — Rauthy, SpiceDB and one PostgreSQL service and database are packaged and installed for development, with separate roles and schema namespaces, the database address as configuration, and readiness, restart, named refusals, the shared database and restore proved (ID001_DEPLOY, ID001_DEPLOY_REFUSAL, ID001_SHARED_DB, ID001_PIN_CLONE).

**Stories:**
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

### R2: Prepare, configure and check the deployment from the lys CLI

THE SYSTEM SHALL implement lys identity prepare, configure and health in the existing lys CLI with exactly revision 5's module manifest (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:154-166): mod.rs declarations and re-exports only; cli.rs the identity subcommand arguments; config.rs typed deployment configuration and validation with no secret value in diagnostics; credentials.rs Zeroizing, redacted credential material and its stable reuse; private_files.rs restricted-mode durable file creation and outcome reconciliation; prepare.rs validating inputs and materialising the declared private artifacts; configure.rs idempotent client and theme reconciliation with stable operation identifiers; rauthy.rs typed Rauthy API requests and responses, named status errors and read-back after an uncertain outcome; health.rs named readiness checks for the declared services; error.rs typed errors carrying operation, resource and path, never secret bytes; themes.rs is R3's. configure SHALL register separate platform and Cambium OIDC clients with exact redirect URIs and RS256 where the Cambium verifier requires it, and the platform's own confidential client with S256 as revision 5 proposes (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:138, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:39). Google and GitHub federation credentials belong to Rauthy; Google API consent remains a different client purpose. Generated credentials stay out of Git and logs, and health output excludes secrets. No Python or shell provisioning engine: health.sh and the external tests/identity_deployment are replaced by these subcommands and Rust integration tests (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:19, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:140).

**Acceptance:**
- A redaction test formats every credential and error type under crates/lys/src/identity/ with Debug and Display, and captures the health output of a configured deployment: none contains a byte of a generated secret.
- prepare creates every declared private file with a restricted mode; a test reads each file's mode and counts the files against the declared set.
- configure run twice against the same Rauthy leaves exactly two clients and their themes with unchanged operation identifiers; a transport failure after a request is resolved by read-back and never creates a second client.
- health names each unready service or database: a test makes each one unavailable in turn and counts one named failure per case, equal to the number of declared services.
- Every module of the manifest exists under crates/lys/src/identity/, no other file is added there, and none exceeds 500 lines of code.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys/src/identity/mod.rs
- create: crates/lys/src/identity/cli.rs
- create: crates/lys/src/identity/config.rs
- create: crates/lys/src/identity/credentials.rs
- create: crates/lys/src/identity/private_files.rs
- create: crates/lys/src/identity/prepare.rs
- create: crates/lys/src/identity/configure.rs
- create: crates/lys/src/identity/rauthy.rs
- create: crates/lys/src/identity/health.rs

- modify: Cargo.toml
- modify: Cargo.lock
- modify: crates/lys/Cargo.toml
- modify: crates/lys/src/main.rs
- modify: crates/lys/src/cli.rs
- modify: crates/lys/src/commands/error.rs

**Checklist:**
- C8 — lys identity prepare, configure and health exist in the CLI exactly as revision 5's module manifest names them, register the platform and Cambium clients idempotently, and keep every secret out of Git, logs, errors and health output.

**Stories:**
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

### R3: Theme both Rauthy clients with Aion's vocabulary and each product's own accent

THE SYSTEM SHALL configure both Rauthy client themes from Aion's pinned neutral, text and radius vocabulary and each client's own product accent (ADR-010): the Cambium client green, the identity client the identity orange. It SHALL map text, text_high, bg, bg_high, action, accent and error into HSL for light and dark, plus button text colour and border radius, in deploy/identity/rauthy-themes.json, recording every source token and colour conversion in deploy/identity/theme-map.md, read and validated by crates/lys/src/identity/themes.rs, and SHALL verify readable contrast (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:139). Fonts and page layout remain Rauthy's; no font or layout patch and no cross-application build dependency enters the fork. The colour values are read from the estate colour tokens, docs/design-system-v2/palette/estate-colour-tokens.json in the ablative docs repository (owner: Waffles, who added the identity entry at ablative-docs 385916e; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:44); that file is another repository's, is read and never changed, and is named here rather than listed in files (CN4). Its purple status token is not copied.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_THEME: inspect both client login pages in light and dark mode; all seven HSL fields, button text and border radius match the declared mapping, persist after restart and retain readable contrast. Record the source-token ref and Rauthy theme export without credentials.
- The Cambium client's accent is Cambium green and the identity client's is the identity orange of the estate tokens; neither is Aion blue, and no purple token appears in deploy/identity/rauthy-themes.json.

**Files:**
- create: deploy/identity/rauthy-themes.json
- create: deploy/identity/theme-map.md
- create: crates/lys/src/identity/themes.rs
- create: crates/lys/tests/identity_theme.rs

**Checklist:**
- C9 — Both Rauthy client themes carry Aion's neutral vocabulary with each product's own accent, Cambium green and the identity orange (ID001_THEME).

**Stories:**
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

### R4: State what SpiceDB enforces in step 1, and hold to it

SpiceDB's step-1 role, in one sentence: in step 1 SpiceDB is installed, migrated, backed up and health-checked against the shared PostgreSQL database, and it enforces nothing, because no component asks it for a permission decision or writes a grant to it, and live capability policy and its enforcement stay with road step 2 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:30; docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:143). What it does not do in step 1: it answers no check for any identity, it holds no grant or relationship of the directory, the lifecycle state recorded by DIRECTORY-003 gates nothing through it, and running it is not permission enforcement. THE SYSTEM SHALL write that sentence into deploy/identity/README.md, and SHALL NOT add to crates/lys/src/identity/ any SpiceDB permission check, relationship write or schema write; health reads SpiceDB's readiness only. Relationships a test writes to prove ID001_SHARED_DB are test fixtures, not grants.

**Acceptance:**
- deploy/identity/README.md carries the step-1 sentence of this requirement word for word.
- A search of crates/lys/src/identity/ finds SpiceDB named only by the health readiness check and its configuration: no permission check, relationship write or schema write call.

**Files:**
- modify: deploy/identity/README.md

**Checklist:**
- C10 — SpiceDB's step-1 role is written down and held: installed and checked, asked for no decision, holding no grant.

**Stories:**
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

## Boundaries

- Only the files listed in this brief's requirements change; a row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and Waffles approves a brief revision before that file is edited (CN9).
- Development isolation: disposable test identities and test provider registrations only; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration (CN2).
- No credential, token or key value is written in code, tests, fixtures, logs or documents; tests use generated values that are never real credentials.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- A live demonstration to Tom is a verification step a person performs after the row lands, never an acceptance criterion and never claimed by a loop completion (CN5, CN6).
- No row is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it.
- lys-core, its cryptographic primitives and its published wire formats are unchanged.
- SpiceDB is asked for no permission decision and holds no grant in this row (R4).
- No Python or shell provisioning engine.

## Verification

- From the repository root: cargo fmt --check; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps, all clean (CLAUDE.md, gates before any commit).
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0.
- From the repository root: rg -n 'ID001_DEPLOY|ID001_DEPLOY_REFUSAL|ID001_THEME|ID001_SHARED_DB|ID001_PIN_CLONE' crates/lys/tests finds each identifier in a test.
- A search of every file this row touches finds no credential, token or key value.

# DIRECTORY-003: Build the directory contract and signed authoritative identity changes

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-002
> **Blocked by:** Waffles' review of this brief before it is dispatched (DIRECTORY-001 boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it), The exact file manifest for crates/lys-identity/, crates/lys-identity-server/ and tests/identity_contract/, reviewed before this row starts; revision 5 requires one for every wholly new module (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:28, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:190) and none is written yet

Register, activate, suspend, reinstate and retire are the only transitions, each one signed audit record naming the authenticated actor and their provenance, the identity, from, to, when and reason. Having a grant or a credential is a fact beside the state, not a state. A person is registered by first sign-in; an agent is registered by a signed-in person, who carries it as its responsible person for life and may cause every transition of their own agents. Source: docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:17-44 and docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:71-95.

## Purpose

Row 04 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5, built before row 03 as Waffles reordered it: the directory of people and agents, where one signed committed event is both the identity change and its audit record, a receipt anyone can verify, the bounded step-1 administrator, and the link-audit receiver row 03 will need. Revised for the grant ruling (ADR-003): every agent is registered under the signed-in person responsible for it; and for the working lifecycle states (ADR-011, proposed): each identity's state is recorded beside it.

## Task

Carry IDENTITY-001 revision 5 row 04 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:168-207) into requirements: registration under a responsible person (R1), signed events and receipts (R2), the administrator (R3), the link-audit receiver (R4) and the lifecycle state, with the grant path's row recorded open for Tom (R5). Estimate: 10 focused implementer hours, revision 5's figure for this row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:206); no re-estimate, because the responsible person and the lifecycle state ride the same signed event envelope and projection as registration. If Tom places the grant path in this row, its hours are estimated then and any ceiling change goes to Tom through Waffles (CN7). The row's crates are wholly new modules: their exact file manifest is reviewed before the row starts (blocked_by, CN9). Every path is relative to the repository root.

## Requirements

### R1: Register people and agents with enduring identifiers, each agent under its responsible person

THE SYSTEM SHALL add the domain crates crates/lys-identity (directory records, typed API, event projection) and crates/lys-identity-server (OIDC session handling, administrator admission), keeping lys-core, its cryptographic primitives and its published formats unchanged, every new module named in the reviewed manifest (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:190). It SHALL define stable person and agent identifiers, external issuer-subject bindings, registration and display-profile changes, explicit provenance and operation-ID retry semantics, written as the contract in docs/design/identity/DIRECTORY-CONTRACT.md (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:191; P1). Revised for the grant ruling (ADR-003; docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:21): an agent is registered by a signed-in person, and its signed registration event records that person as the agent's responsible person for life (docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:77-81). ADR-011 proposes that a person registers themselves by first sign-in; step 1's bounded administrator policy refuses every other mutation caller (P9; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:38), so in step 1 the only caller that may register a person or an agent is the configured administrator (R3), a first sign-in registers nobody, and every agent's responsible person is the administrator who registered it; wider registration arrives with step 2's assignment (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:38). No API of this row changes an agent's responsible person. Registering an agent SHALL NOT pretend it is running, manufacture a human login for it, or issue it a credential, handle or certificate (P3; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:37). The deployment files gain the directory service beside the three dependencies.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_DIRECTORY: register a person and an agent, edit the display profile, list/read both and reopen; enduring IDs and signed history remain unchanged.
- A registered agent's record and its signed registration event both name its responsible person, the signed-in person who registered it; a registration without a signed-in caller is refused and creates no record; no request of the API changes an agent's responsible person.
- Registering an agent creates no Rauthy user and issues no credential, handle or certificate: a test counts Rauthy users and issued credentials before and after a registration and finds both counts unchanged.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/
- create: tests/identity_contract/
- create: docs/design/identity/DIRECTORY-CONTRACT.md
- modify: Cargo.toml
- modify: Cargo.lock
- modify: deploy/identity/compose.yaml
- modify: deploy/identity/config.example.toml
- modify: deploy/identity/README.md

**Checklist:**
- C11 — People and agents are registered with enduring identifiers and issuer-subject bindings, each agent under the signed-in person responsible for it, and registration issues no login, credential or certificate (ID001_DIRECTORY).

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.
- S4 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want to register an agent under my name before it ever runs, with every change to it signed, so that who created it and who answers for it is never reconstructed after the fact.

### R2: Commit every identity change as one signed event through lys-log-store

THE SYSTEM SHALL commit every signed directory change through lys-log-store and rebuild projections from those events at open, reconciling an uncertain write before any affected read answers as current (P4, P5; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:192, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:40). The versioned event envelope, outside lys-core, with typed audit and context payloads, the log coordinate returned in the receipt outside the leaf and service-attested human actions, SHALL be reviewed jointly with Archie before it signs durable bytes, and written in docs/design/identity/IDENTITY-EVENTS.md; the commitment hash is named explicitly, and a SHA-256 attestation commitment is never confused with a BLAKE3 content address (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:45). A receipt carries the fields of P7. THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a read-only receipt and inclusion-verification path (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:193). The service attests the authenticated human actor and their provenance and never claims a person signed bytes with a key they do not hold (P8). The log is lys-log-store's file storage, not a Haematite backend (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:45).

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_AUDIT_FAULTS: enumerate append/pin/projection crash boundaries and count exercised cases; every answered projection equals replay; uncertain operations retain identity and resolve once without silent loss or double application.
- ID001_RECEIPT: independently verify a recorded change against a checkpoint/key; changed actor, payload, sequence or signature fails verification. Secret-redaction tests cover debug, errors and serialized public responses.
- docs/design/identity/IDENTITY-EVENTS.md records the envelope's version, its typed payloads and the named commitment hash, and records Archie's review of it before any durable bytes are signed under it.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/
- create: tests/identity_contract/
- create: docs/design/identity/IDENTITY-EVENTS.md

**Checklist:**
- C12 — Every identity change is one signed event through lys-log-store under a jointly reviewed envelope, every answered projection equals replay across the crash boundaries, and a receipt verifies independently (ID001_AUDIT_FAULTS, ID001_RECEIPT).

**Stories:**
- S4 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want to register an agent under my name before it ever runs, with every change to it signed, so that who created it and who answers for it is never reconstructed after the fact.
- S7 (Verifier, Checks a recorded identity change without the operator's cooperation) — As a verifier, I want to check a recorded identity change against a checkpoint and key with standard tooling, so that the directory's history does not rest on the operator's word.

### R3: Admit only the configured administrator to change the directory

THE SYSTEM SHALL authenticate the initial directory administrator by an explicitly configured issuer and subject, never by email or by being the first visitor, fail closed for every other mutation caller, and make the limited step-1 authority visible (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:193, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:38; P9). General assignment and why-access views arrive in step 2.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_ADMIN: an unauthenticated caller, a non-admin with the same email, and wrong issuer/subject are refused; denied calls cannot mutate state.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/
- create: tests/identity_contract/

**Checklist:**
- C13 — Only the configured administrator mutates the directory in step 1; unauthenticated, same-email and wrong issuer-subject callers are refused without effect (ID001_ADMIN).

**Stories:**
- S4 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want to register an agent under my name before it ever runs, with every change to it signed, so that who created it and who answers for it is never reconstructed after the fact.

### R4: Build the link-audit receiver before row 03 needs it

THE SYSTEM SHALL build and test the authenticated link-audit receiver against the reviewed typed contract and fixtures before DIRECTORY-004 needs it. It consumes the minimal durable source selected in row 01 (a same-transaction link audit record or outbox with stable operation IDs and explicit pending and acknowledged state; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:42), deduplicates stable source operation IDs and returns verifiable receipts. It separates issuer observations from human-signed claims, and audit actor provenance survives replay (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:194).

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_RECEIVER: fixture delivery, duplicate delivery, lost acknowledgement, receiver restart and unauthorized source exercise the reviewed link-audit contract without requiring the future multi-provider fork. Count each leg and prove one logical event per source operation.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/
- create: tests/identity_contract/

**Checklist:**
- C14 — The link-audit receiver is built and proved against fixtures before row 03 needs it (ID001_RECEIVER).

**Stories:**
- S7 (Verifier, Checks a recorded identity change without the operator's cooperation) — As a verifier, I want to check a recorded identity change against a checkpoint and key with standard tooling, so that the directory's history does not rest on the operator's word.

### R5: Record each identity's lifecycle state, and keep the grant path's row open

THE SYSTEM SHALL record beside each identity its lifecycle state as ADR-011 proposes (docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:17-44): registration yields registered; activate, suspend, reinstate and retire are the only transitions, each one signed directory event naming the authenticated actor and their provenance, the identity, from, to, when and the reason given; a retired identity is never reactivated; a transition outside the table is refused by name and records nothing. In step 1 the caller is the configured administrator (R3). The state is recorded, not enforced: nothing in this row reads it to admit or refuse an action (CN11). ADR-011 is status proposed; a change to the states by Tom is a brief revision before this requirement is built.

OPEN for Tom, not decided here: which row owns the grant path. The path: a person signs in, creates an agent under themselves, grants it one project, the agent's action on that project is allowed, the grant is revoked or the agent suspended, and the same action is refused by name, with the audit record naming who made each change (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:183, Chippy 17:08; docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md:39-46). The sources do not settle its row. Revision 5 keeps arbitrary grants and live capability enforcement out of step 1 and in road step 2 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:29-30). Chippy's concrete first screen of 17:08, said after revision 5 was written, puts the path on step 1's screen (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:183), and PROVISIONING places the grant in 'steps 1 and 2 of the road' without naming a row (docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md:23-24). The question for Tom: does the grant path land in this row (DIRECTORY-003), in a new row of this cluster before DIRECTORY-005, or in the first brief of road step 2? Whichever row it lands in carries these criteria, drafted here so none is lost: (a) allowed before revoke: with the agent active and one grant on project P, the agent's action on P is admitted; (b) refused after revoke: once the grant is revoked, the same action is refused by name at the next check and nothing on P changes; (c) refused after suspend: once the agent is suspended, the same action is refused by name while its grant stays recorded, under whatever suspension semantics Tom settles (design non-goals); (d) every grant, revoke and transition is one signed audit record naming the actor. None of (a) to (d) is an acceptance criterion of this brief.

**Acceptance:**
- A test drives register, activate, suspend, reinstate and retire on one agent and counts 5 signed events, each naming actor, identity, from, to and time; the projection after reopen equals replay.
- Each transition outside the table (retired to active, registered to suspended, registered to retired, and a transition of an unknown identity) is refused by name and the log's size does not change; the test counts one refusal per case it names.
- No code in this row asks SpiceDB for a decision or writes a grant to it, and the grant path's row is still recorded open for Tom, with its question and drafted criteria, when the row is reviewed.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/
- create: tests/identity_contract/
- create: docs/design/identity/DIRECTORY-CONTRACT.md

**Checklist:**
- C15 — Each identity's lifecycle state is recorded as ADR-011 proposes, every transition one signed event, and the grant path's row is recorded open for Tom with its criteria drafted.

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.

## Boundaries

- Only the files listed in this brief's requirements change; a row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and Waffles approves a brief revision before that file is edited (CN9).
- Development isolation: disposable test identities and test provider registrations only; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration (CN2).
- No credential, token or key value is written in code, tests, fixtures, logs or documents; tests use generated values that are never real credentials.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- A live demonstration to Tom is a verification step a person performs after the row lands, never an acceptance criterion and never claimed by a loop completion (CN5, CN6).
- No row is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it.
- lys-core, its cryptographic primitives and its published wire formats are unchanged; the event envelope lives outside lys-core and signs no durable bytes before its joint review with Archie.
- No grant is written and no permission is enforced in this row; the grant path's row stays open for Tom (R5).
- Registration issues no login, credential, handle or certificate.

## Verification

- From the repository root: cargo fmt --check; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps, all clean (CLAUDE.md, gates before any commit).
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0.
- From the repository root: rg -n 'ID001_DIRECTORY|ID001_AUDIT_FAULTS|ID001_ADMIN|ID001_RECEIPT|ID001_RECEIVER' crates/lys-identity tests/identity_contract finds each identifier in a test.
- A search of every file this row touches finds no credential, token or key value.

# DIRECTORY-004: Link two upstream providers to one Rauthy person

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-003
> **Blocked by:** The card on the ablative-io/rauthy fork's own board for the two-provider link, not yet raised, which carries the fork-owned brief for row 03's Rauthy changes (vendor/rauthy, branch ablative; maintenance owner Chippy, Waffles reviewing, docs/design/identity/RAUTHY-BASELINE.md:39) and its build through the fork's own chain. No card carries that brief yet and this brief does not write it or build the linking code. R1 does not start until that card has landed a gated commit on the ablative branch; R2 does not wait on it, DIRECTORY-003's landing, including R4's link-audit receiver and the typed contract and fixtures it authors: the precondition of R2, checked by git ls-tree origin/main tests/identity_contract listing the receiver's contract directory on lys main, Waffles' review of this brief before it is dispatched (DIRECTORY-001 boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it)
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-009 — People sign in through a maintained Rauthy fork of our own — Rauthy authenticates people, and its one-provider-per-user limit is changed in a fork we maintain, ablative-io/rauthy, not contributed upstream as a prerequisite. The maintained branch is ablative, created from upstream v0.36.2 commit dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; the fork's main stays an untouched upstream mirror; lys pins an exact commit of ablative as the submodule vendor/rauthy. Upgrades rebase ablative onto upstream release tags only, each in its own gated row; no cherry-picks and no reset of main.
> **Checklist:**
> - C16 — The pinned fork commit links Google and GitHub to one unchanged Rauthy person, refuses every collision and replay, migrates both storages and audits each link atomically (ID001_LINK_PAIR, ID001_LINK_REFUSAL, ID001_LINK_MIGRATION, ID001_LINK_AUDIT).
> - C17 — The provider-link contract and the links report are written, and the report names the gated fork commit the pin moves to.
> **Stories:**
> - S5 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As a person signing in, I want Google and GitHub to resolve to the one me, so that adding a provider never splits me into two people or merges me with someone who shares my email.

## Purpose

Row 03 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5: Google and GitHub resolve to one Rauthy person, collisions are refused rather than merged by email, and each link and unlink is audited atomically and acknowledged by the receiver DIRECTORY-003 built. The linking change lives in the maintained fork (ADR-009), a repository of its own; this brief is the lys side of the row: the pin, the provider-link contract and the report.

## Task

Carry IDENTITY-001 revision 5 row 03 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:208-262). The fork's files are the fork-owned brief's (blocked_by) and are named in R1's spec with their owner, never listed in files (CN4). This brief moves vendor/rauthy to the fork commit that brief lands and gates (R1), and writes the provider-link contract and the links report (R2). Estimate: 10 focused implementer hours, revision 5's figure for the whole row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:261), shared between this brief and the fork-owned brief; no re-estimate, and the split is stated when the fork-owned brief is written. The row's live demonstration, ID001_LINK_LIVE, is a verification step after the row lands and holds DIRECTORY-005 (CN6).

## Requirements

### R1: Move the pin to the gated fork commit that links two providers to one person

THE SYSTEM SHALL move the vendor/rauthy submodule pin to a commit on the fork's ablative branch that carries the linking change and has passed the fork-owned brief's gate (ADR-009); the pin never names an ungated or cherry-picked commit.

The linking change, owned by the fork-owned brief and named here only (owner: the ablative-io/rauthy fork, its maintenance owner as recorded in docs/design/identity/RAUTHY-BASELINE.md:39; paths relative to the fork's root, from revision 5's wall, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:216-238): src/api/src/auth_providers.rs, src/api_types/src/auth_providers.rs, src/api_types/src/users.rs, src/data/src/entity/auth_providers.rs, src/data/src/entity/users.rs, src/data/src/entity/mod.rs, src/data/src/entity/identity_links.rs, src/data/src/entity/identity_link_audit.rs, src/data/src/migration/inserts.rs, src/service/src/oidc/auth_providers/login_finish.rs, src/service/src/oidc/auth_providers/login_start.rs, frontend/src/api/types/auth_provider.ts, frontend/src/api/types/user.ts, frontend/src/lib/account/AccMain.svelte, frontend/src/lib/account/AccOther.svelte, frontend/src/lib/account/AccLinkedProviders.svelte, frontend/src/lib/admin/users/UserInfo.svelte, frontend/src/routes/providers/callback/+page.svelte, migrations/hiqlite/32_identity_links.sql, migrations/postgres/V27__identity_links.sql, and the ID001_LINK_* tests in a compiled member crate of the fork's workspace under src/, at the path the fork's card chooses, which the fork gate's cargo test runs (this replaces revision 5's tests/identity_links/, which the fork's virtual workspace, members src/*, never compiles). Its work, from revision 5 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:246-249): replace the single provider pair with a link relation unique on provider and subject, migrating existing links transactionally without changing Rauthy user IDs, with row 01's exact migration filenames confirmed before code starts; require an authenticated person, fresh reauthentication and a single-use target-bound linking intent, bind state, nonce, provider and callback, and reject identity collision instead of merging by matching email; update every reader row 01 found, including administrative deletion, export and import; list links, and unlink only after confirming the identity keeps a usable authentication or recovery method, preserving upstream account security controls; commit link or unlink and its audit provenance atomically through the minimal durable link-audit design selected in row 01, and label the audit complete only on an acknowledged Lys receipt from the DIRECTORY-003 receiver, so a duplicate delivery never creates another identity event.

WHEN no commit on the ablative branch of ablative-io/rauthy has passed the fork's own chain, THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT start R1 and SHALL NOT move the pin; R1 SHALL NOT name a commit whose ID001_LINK_* tests sit outside a crate the fork gate compiles.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_LINK_PAIR: Google then GitHub, and GitHub then Google, resolve to one unchanged user subject; sign out and back in through either provider and reopen storage.
- ID001_LINK_REFUSAL: same email with different subject, already-owned provider identity, replayed/cross-account intent, CSRF/nonce mismatch and final-login unlink are refused with no unintended link.
- ID001_LINK_MIGRATION: both supported storage migrations preserve IDs and links, restart safely after interruption and refuse incompatible schema versions by name.
- ID001_LINK_AUDIT: crash after database commit but before audit acknowledgement retains the outbox; delivery/retry yields one logical signed event. Audit outage is visible, never a false completed receipt.
- Precondition, before R1 starts: git ls-remote https://github.com/ablative-io/rauthy refs/heads/ablative prints a commit id other than dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662, and the fork gate's recorded result for that exact commit id reads passed.
- vendor/rauthy names that gated commit on the ablative branch; at it, rg -n 'ID001_LINK_PAIR|ID001_LINK_REFUSAL|ID001_LINK_MIGRATION|ID001_LINK_AUDIT' vendor/rauthy finds each of the four identifiers in a test, and the fork gate's cargo test log for that commit names each ID001_LINK_* test with a passed result; an identifier found by rg with no passed result in the log fails this line.

**Files:**
- modify: vendor/rauthy

**Checklist:**
- C16 — The pinned fork commit links Google and GitHub to one unchanged Rauthy person, refuses every collision and replay, migrates both storages and audits each link atomically (ID001_LINK_PAIR, ID001_LINK_REFUSAL, ID001_LINK_MIGRATION, ID001_LINK_AUDIT).

**Stories:**
- S5 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As a person signing in, I want Google and GitHub to resolve to the one me, so that adding a provider never splits me into two people or merges me with someone who shares my email.

### R2: Write the provider-link contract and the links report

THE SYSTEM SHALL write docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md, the fork-side record of the typed link-audit contract that the DIRECTORY-003 receiver authors in lys with its fixtures (stable source operation IDs, pending and acknowledged states, what an issuer observes as against what a person claims): it names the lys contract by path and by the lys commit it was read at, and states the wire shape the fork sends in those terms. It SHALL also write docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md, the report of the row: the fork commit the pin moves to, its gate result, the counted legs of each ID001_LINK_* case and the development install's release-and-advisory check (CN10). Both keep the file names revision 5 gives this row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:241-242).

WHEN DIRECTORY-003 has not landed, THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT start R2. R2 SHALL NOT author any field, state or fixture the receiver does not already hold, and a difference between the record and the receiver's contract SHALL be reported as a finding against the fork and SHALL NOT change the receiver.

**Acceptance:**
- docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md names the lys contract path and the lys commit it was read at, names every field the receiver reads and the states a link audit passes through, and the DIRECTORY-003 receiver's fixtures at that commit match it.
- docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md names the pinned fork commit, its gate result and the count of exercised legs per identifier, and records the release-and-advisory check of the install.

**Files:**
- create: docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md
- create: docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md

**Checklist:**
- C17 — The provider-link contract and the links report are written, and the report names the gated fork commit the pin moves to.

**Stories:**
- S5 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As a person signing in, I want Google and GitHub to resolve to the one me, so that adding a provider never splits me into two people or merges me with someone who shares my email.

## Boundaries

- Only the files listed in this brief's requirements change; a row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and Waffles approves a brief revision before that file is edited (CN9).
- Development isolation: disposable test identities and test provider registrations only; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration (CN2).
- No credential, token or key value is written in code, tests, fixtures, logs or documents; tests use generated values that are never real credentials.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- A live demonstration to Tom is a verification step a person performs after the row lands, never an acceptance criterion and never claimed by a loop completion (CN5, CN6).
- No row is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it.
- No fork file is edited by this brief: the fork's changes land through the fork-owned brief and its gate, and reach this repository only as a pin.
- No cherry-pick and no nightly base: rows 02 to 05 run on v0.36.2 (CN10).
- Revision under CN9: revision 5's wall entry tests/identity_links/ is replaced by the ID001_LINK_* tests in a compiled member crate under src/ of the fork's workspace, at the path the fork's card chooses, and the verification becomes the rg search together with the fork gate's cargo test log. Approved by the identity line's lead in the answer to survey question survey-question-7c352c54a390.

## Verification

- From the repository root: cargo fmt --check; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps, all clean (CLAUDE.md, gates before any commit).
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0.
- From the repository root, with submodules checked out: rg -n 'ID001_LINK_PAIR|ID001_LINK_REFUSAL|ID001_LINK_MIGRATION|ID001_LINK_AUDIT' vendor/rauthy finds each identifier in a test, and the fork gate's cargo test log for the pinned commit names each ID001_LINK_* test with its result; a test found but never run fails the check.
- ID001_LINK_LIVE, after the row lands (CN5, CN6): a person installs the exact gated fork and shows Tom two linked providers resolving to one person in Rauthy's own account page, signing in through both, then posts a separate install and showing receipt to Tom with the Melbourne pass time, fork ref, artifact hash and observed result. A venue test or screenshot alone does not replace the live demonstration, and DIRECTORY-005 stays blocked until the receipt is recorded.

# DIRECTORY-005: Complete the standalone screen journey

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-004
> **Blocked by:** ID001_LINK_LIVE: Tom's live demonstration of row 03 (DIRECTORY-004), recorded by its posted install and showing receipt with the Melbourne pass time, fork ref, artifact hash and observed result; a loop completion never stands in for it (CN6), Waffles' review of this brief before it is dispatched (DIRECTORY-001 boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it), The exact file manifest for surface/identity/, reviewed before this row starts (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:28)
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
> - ADR-007 — The product starts an agent by giving its start command, never by running it — The product is not an execution engine. For the first release an agent's file gives the command that starts it on a chosen machine: the command carries the agent's identity and its handles, never a credential's value, and it is rendered from the agent's kept launch record. A started agent reports back, so the sessions screen shows what is running. A terminal inside the product, sandboxes, virtual machines and containers are later runtimes that plug in, and none is built into this product.
> - ADR-008 — An agent's file shows its lys certificate — An agent's file shows its lys certificate once one is issued: what it claims, who signed it, when it was issued and when it expires, with the signed receipts of the changes made to it. An agent registered before any key or proof of possession was supplied shows its certificate as not issued, never a placeholder.
> - ADR-010 — Every product shares one design and keeps its own accent; the identity product's is orange — The identity screens follow Aion's structure, typography, spacing and interaction, and Rauthy's client themes take the same colours, with no build dependency on Cambium or Aion. Each product keeps its own accent within the estate colour family: Cambium green, Aion blue and black, Argus light blue, Haematite mustard. The identity product's accent is orange (accent #D4975A, deep #A86B2E, wash #3D2A17 in the estate colour tokens), set apart from Manifold's copper. No product is silently made Aion-blue, and purple is not used.
> **Checklist:**
> - C18 — The standalone journey (sign in, the directory, a record, registering and editing an agent, linked accounts, signed history) works with Cambium and Manifold absent, each agent showing its responsible person (ID001_STANDALONE).
> - C19 — Expired login, unauthorized edit, provider collision, audit pending and backend outage each have a visible, actionable outcome and no optimistic completed state (ID001_SCREEN_REFUSAL).
> - C20 — The screens follow Aion's appearance with the identity product's own orange accent and no build dependency on Cambium or Aion (ADR-010).
> **Stories:**
> - S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.
> - S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.
> - S6 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want the directory's screens to show every refusal, pending audit and outage as it is, so that I never act on a completed state that did not happen.

## Purpose

Row 05 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5: the standalone product's own screens, 'beyond just a login page', so an operator installs, signs in, links two providers, registers an agent and reads its signed history with Cambium and Manifold absent. Revised for the grant ruling (ADR-003): each agent shows the person responsible for it, and the screen does not present access or delegation it cannot yet grant.

## Task

Carry IDENTITY-001 revision 5 row 05 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:263-294) into requirements: the screen journey (R1), visible refusals (R2) and the appearance (R3). Estimate: 6 focused implementer hours, revision 5's figure for this row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:293); no re-estimate. surface/identity/ is a wholly new module: its exact file manifest is reviewed before the row starts (CN9). The row's live demonstration, ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE, is a verification step after the row lands and is the design's hold point before any row 06 (CN6). Every path is relative to the repository root.

## Requirements

### R1: Build the standalone screen journey

THE SYSTEM SHALL build sign-in, the directory of people and agents, record detail, register and edit agent, the linked-account entry point and signed change history in surface/identity/, served by crates/lys-identity-server/src/routes.rs and crates/lys-identity-server/src/assets.rs, with boundary types generated from the server schema, preserving shared lifecycle extension points without implementing Archie's screens (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:280). Registration states what has been created. Revised for the grant ruling (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:21, Chippy 17:17, agreed): each agent's record shows its responsible person and its recorded lifecycle state (ADR-011, proposed); where the statement's first screen shows the access granted and the delegation rights beside the responsible person, step 1 shows them as not yet available, never as empty working controls. An agent's certificate shows as not issued, never a placeholder (ADR-008). Controls for launch, a start command (ADR-007), live permissions, secrets and memory are not presented as working in step 1 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:282). deploy/identity/README.md gains the screen's install and use, and docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-standalone.md records the row's evidence.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_STANDALONE: with Cambium and Manifold absent, an operator installs, signs in, links two providers, creates an agent, returns after restart and finds the same records and inspectable change history.
- Use the native browser against the installed venue artifact; record screenshots and observed actions plus artifact hashes in docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-standalone.md. A mockup or frontend build alone is not this acceptance.
- Each agent's record shows its responsible person and its recorded lifecycle state; its access and delegation rights show as not available in step 1, never as empty working controls; its certificate shows as not issued; no control for launch, permissions, secrets or memory is presented as working.

**Files:**
- create: surface/identity/
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/src/assets.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/src/routes.rs
- create: docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-standalone.md
- modify: deploy/identity/README.md

**Checklist:**
- C18 — The standalone journey (sign in, the directory, a record, registering and editing an agent, linked accounts, signed history) works with Cambium and Manifold absent, each agent showing its responsible person (ID001_STANDALONE).

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

### R2: Show every refusal, pending audit and outage as it is

THE SYSTEM SHALL show provider-link audit pending, unavailable services and named refusals accurately, with an actionable visible outcome for each and no optimistic completed state after a refusal (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:281, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:286; P5).

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_SCREEN_REFUSAL: expired login, unauthorized edit, provider collision, audit-pending and backend outage have actionable visible outcomes; no optimistic completed state after refusal.

**Files:**
- create: surface/identity/

**Checklist:**
- C19 — Expired login, unauthorized edit, provider collision, audit pending and backend outage each have a visible, actionable outcome and no optimistic completed state (ID001_SCREEN_REFUSAL).

**Stories:**
- S6 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want the directory's screens to show every refusal, pending audit and outage as it is, so that I never act on a completed state that did not happen.

### R3: Follow Aion's appearance with the identity product's own accent

THE SYSTEM SHALL follow Aion's structure, DM Sans and JetBrains Mono typography, radii, spacing and browser interaction conventions, with the identity product's own orange accent instead of Aion-blue (ADR-010; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:281). Neutral design values keep their pinned provenance and the accent values are separately declared, read from the estate colour tokens (docs/design-system-v2/palette/estate-colour-tokens.json in the ablative docs repository, owner Waffles; named, not listed in files, CN4), with no build dependency on Cambium or Aion. Central design-system extraction is outside this brief.

**Acceptance:**
- The screens' accent values are the identity orange of the estate tokens with their recorded source ref; no Aion-blue accent and no purple appear, and the frontend build names no Cambium or Aion package.

**Files:**
- create: surface/identity/

**Checklist:**
- C20 — The screens follow Aion's appearance with the identity product's own orange accent and no build dependency on Cambium or Aion (ADR-010).

**Stories:**
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

## Boundaries

- Only the files listed in this brief's requirements change; a row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and Waffles approves a brief revision before that file is edited (CN9).
- Development isolation: disposable test identities and test provider registrations only; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration (CN2).
- No credential, token or key value is written in code, tests, fixtures, logs or documents; tests use generated values that are never real credentials.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- A live demonstration to Tom is a verification step a person performs after the row lands, never an acceptance criterion and never claimed by a loop completion (CN5, CN6).
- No row is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it.
- Archie's lifecycle screens are not implemented; their extension points are kept.
- No grant, launch, secret or memory control is presented as working in step 1.

## Verification

- From the repository root: cargo fmt --check; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps, all clean (CLAUDE.md, gates before any commit).
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0.
- From the repository root: rg -n 'ID001_STANDALONE|ID001_SCREEN_REFUSAL' surface/identity finds each identifier in a test.
- ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE, after the row lands (CN5, CN6): a person installs the gated standalone directory and completes its journey with Tom in a live browser, then posts a separate line to Tom with the Melbourne pass time, installed refs and hashes and what was demonstrated, before any row 06 starts; no deferral to row 07. This is the design's hold point: the brief that follows is blocked by it until Tom's receipt is recorded, and the choice of Rauthy base recorded in the design's non-goals falls due at this showing if no suitable upstream release exists (CN10).
- Frontend checks pass with strict types and the generated API schema, with negative and crash-boundary tests.

# DIRECTORY-006: Enforce human-rooted grants, explicit delegation and the You-page access journey

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-002, DIRECTORY-003
> **Blocked by:** Waffles review of every requirement and the accepted mock-up/conformance snapshot before dispatch., DIRECTORY-002 and DIRECTORY-003 are published foundation briefs, not implemented foundations. DIRECTORY-003 must establish the identity crates, reviewed event envelope and server integration manifest; reconcile every future modify path below against its landed implementation before dispatch. The listed new grant modules do not exist in current source., Surface integration waits for DIRECTORY-005 to establish surface/identity and its route/type-generation paths. R6 cannot dispatch before that dependency; DIRECTORY-005 must not depend on R6, so backend grant work and screen integration have separate readiness., Reviewed grant representation, root-authority bootstrap and SpiceDB consistency contract remain open in DIRECTORY-001C5 and ADR-003. Behavioural tests below constrain that design; they do not authorise freezing a cryptographic format., Lifecycle suspension semantics and role version policy are supplied by their reviewed ADRs. Reinstatement safety and expiry invariants here do not settle their remaining policy choices., Review of the proposed R1 grant schema and R4 freshness mechanism; their additional fields and consistency strategy are proposals, not existing settled policy.
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
> - ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
> - ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL, possibly on a network device — PostgreSQL is used for the identity product's database. It may be set up on one of the network devices rather than on Tom's Mac.
> **Checklist:**
> - C21 — The proposed application grant schema separates exercise and pass-on authority; its additional fields require independent review before dispatch and do not change published crypto formats.
> - C22 — Delegation requires an explicit permission to delegate to the requested subject kind; use-only, absent policy and owner labels cannot create it.
> - C23 — Every grant is bounded by a live, acyclic ancestry to a responsible person; scope is evaluated by model actions/resources, never display-name rank.
> - C24 — Grant changes and their audit share one durable authoritative event; retries and uncertain outcomes preserve operation identity and replay-equivalent projections.
> - C25 — Revocation stops derived authority while independent authority remains usable; the proposed revision-freshness mechanism is reviewed before dispatch.
> - C26 — Inherited expiry and provisional end dates are enforced at admission; role changes and reinstatement cannot resurrect expired or revoked authority.
> - C27 — Typed browser/API/agent seams use one authenticated evaluator; forward and reverse explanations name the same authority path and revision without private-record leakage.
> - C28 — Observed grant usage names its source and time; not seen is not reported as never used.
> - C29 — The You and delegation screens show real server authority, separate service accounts from sign-in identities, and preserve personal versus administrator visibility.
> - C30 — The accepted mock-up conformance is tested through actual requests, refusals, pending outcomes, keyboard paths and durable read-back rather than simulated success.
> **Stories:**
> - S8 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a responsible person, I want to give my agent a bounded part of my authority and revoke it, so the same action is allowed before revocation and refused after it.
> - S9 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person or agent with use-only permission, I want the service to explain why I cannot pass it on; with explicit pass-on rights I want the same permitted operation available through UI and tools.
> - S10 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As an auditor, I want grant changes and retries tied to one durable signed operation, so restart or an uncertain reply cannot invent, lose or duplicate authority.
> - S11 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person granting temporary access, I want its end date and ancestor restrictions enforced, so role changes or reinstatement cannot silently extend it.
> - S12 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As an authorised reviewer, I want to ask why this identity can act and who can reach a resource using the same current decision, without exposing records I may not inspect.

## Purpose

Make the human-rooted grant path enforceable: sign in, give an agent a bounded permission, prove the action works, revoke the source, and prove the same action is refused. Use and lending are separate positive rights and the screen explains the real server decision. Authority for this amendment: docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md at commit 1353c22, rows 1.3, 1.4, 2.1–2.6 and 7.3. Context only: Tom requested complete briefs tied to the mock-up on 23 September 2026 at 19:04:22 Melbourne, then the right Cambium boards and workflows at 19:10:35; these conversational times are not repository evidence.

## Task

Implement R1–R5 in order after the directory/service foundations, then R6 after the standalone surface foundation. Estimated work: R1 2h, R2 3h (ancestry/refusal matrix), R3 4h (forced durability boundaries), R4 3h (freshness and expiry), R5 2h, R6 3h (two-person browser evidence), total 17 hours as a new increment, not silently inside IDENTITY-001's 48-hour ceiling. Estimates are proposals for review. Exact file walls follow the new crate roots already named by IDENTITY-001 rows 04/05; none is asserted implemented. Every future modify path must be reconciled to those dependencies' actual manifests before dispatch. Preserve all ID001 requirements in their owning predecessor briefs and the frozen IDENTITY-001 history. In scope: domain grants, authority enforcement, durable audit, explanation API and You/delegation UI. Out: provider federation changes, secret-value storage/proxy, actual process execution, assistant actions, graph renderer and published cryptographic format changes.

## Requirements

### R1: Define the reviewed grant contract without changing published cryptography

PROPOSAL FOR REVIEW, not a settled grant schema: define a typed application grant contract that identifies the grant, issuer, holder, responsible person, resource, exercisable actions, explicit pass-on authority and permitted recipient kinds, source grant, time window, policy revision and authorising audit event. Exercising an action and delegating it SHALL be separate decisions. A missing pass-on field SHALL NOT mean permission. Relations SHALL resolve through the reviewed model to action/resource sets; the code SHALL NOT infer a global owner/editor/viewer rank from display strings. Before any durable grant is signed, the event envelope, canonical encoding, root-authority bootstrap and lineage semantics SHALL be independently reviewed. This row defines application-domain types in lys-identity; it SHALL NOT reinterpret seat/speaks-for or mutate lys/delegation/v1, which currently supplies neither this capability schema nor an expiry. Provenance: ADR-003; STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md, Everything is pegged to a human authority; PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md, What one grant says. Conformance 1.3, 1.4, 2.2, 2.3. The extra holder, responsible-person, recipient-kind, time-window, policy-revision and authorising-event fields are design proposals in this row; PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md supplies five source facts and leaves representation open. This row and GRANT_CONTRACT cannot be dispatched until independent contract review ratifies the schema. Checkable conformance source: docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md at commit 1353c22.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_CONTRACT: serialise/parse a grant with each declared member and independently supplied schema fixture; unknown members, absent required authority, malformed lineage and unknown recipient kinds refuse by name. Count each case; no permission is supplied by a deserialisation default.
- GRANT_MODEL: define two model relations whose names do not imply their action sets. A requested subset is checked against the model, not lexical order or a hard-coded rank; model version is retained in the decision.
- GRANT_WIRE_BOUNDARY: an explicit reviewed application-envelope identifier precedes the first durable signed grant. Existing published lys wire-vector tests remain byte-identical; an unratified delegation format is not used as a substitute capability token.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/mod.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/types.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/error.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_contract.rs
- create: docs/design/identity/GRANT-CONTRACT.md
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/lib.rs

**Checklist:**
- C21 — The proposed application grant schema separates exercise and pass-on authority; its additional fields require independent review before dispatch and do not change published crypto formats.

**Stories:**
- S8 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a responsible person, I want to give my agent a bounded part of my authority and revoke it, so the same action is allowed before revocation and refused after it.

### R2: Enforce affirmative delegation and bounded ancestry

WHEN a person or agent asks to delegate authority, THE SYSTEM SHALL check the actor's current exercise and delegation rights, requested resource/actions and recipient kind against every effective ancestor, ending at an authorised person. The requested authority SHALL be an explicit subset, never inherited wholesale. A use-only grant, an owner label, missing prohibition or access to the UI SHALL NOT establish pass-on authority. People-only authority SHALL refuse agents even when the person owns that agent. Unknown parents, cycles, wrong responsible persons and attempts to launder authority through a new role, secret handle or sibling grant SHALL refuse before any mutation. An agent that holds explicit pass-on permission may invoke the same operation as a person; being an agent alone is not either a permit or a categorical prohibition. The policy determines recipients rather than the mock-up's sample restriction to the caller's own agents. Provenance: ADR-003; AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md. Conformance 2.1–2.4, 7.3. Secret lending also recognises server-verified real ownership as the affirmative route in docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md at commit 1353c22 row 7.3; a display label is not that ownership record.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_USE_VS_LEND: Tom may read a project through Dana's use-only grant. His read succeeds; browser, direct API and agent-tool attempts to grant that access to his agent all refuse and create zero grant events. Add a distinct affirmative pass-on grant: the bounded control now succeeds.
- GRANT_RECIPIENT: exercise human-only, agent-only and non-delegable grants with both recipient kinds. Assert each named permit/refusal and exact zero mutations on denied requests, including the owner's own agent case.
- GRANT_ANCESTRY: attempt a broader resource, broader action, a forged parent, a cycle, a changed responsible person and a revoked ancestor. Each refuses with the blocking boundary. A two-hop permitted narrower chain succeeds and explains its actual ancestors.
- GRANT_AGENT_PARITY: the same authenticated authority and request produce the same effective decision through browser/API/tool routes. An agent granted pass-on can delegate inside that grant; an agent without it cannot.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/admission.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/lineage.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/authority.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_delegation.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C22 — Delegation requires an explicit permission to delegate to the requested subject kind; use-only, absent policy and owner labels cannot create it.
- C23 — Every grant is bounded by a live, acyclic ancestry to a responsible person; scope is evaluated by model actions/resources, never display-name rank.

**Stories:**
- S8 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a responsible person, I want to give my agent a bounded part of my authority and revoke it, so the same action is allowed before revocation and refused after it.
- S9 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person or agent with use-only permission, I want the service to explain why I cannot pass it on; with explicit pass-on rights I want the same permitted operation available through UI and tools.

### R3: Commit grants and their audit as one replayable operation

THE SYSTEM SHALL record a grant mutation as one signed authoritative event using DIRECTORY-003's reviewed event owner, and derive both the directory projection and the permission projection from that event. A database write followed by best-effort audit is forbidden. Each mutation SHALL carry a stable operation ID; the same ID and payload returns the same logical outcome, while changed payload under that ID refuses. Unknown append or projection outcomes SHALL remain named and retained for reconciliation; the API SHALL NOT manufacture success or issue a fresh operation when acknowledgement is lost. Any read or admission that depends on unresolved authority SHALL refuse naming the affected grant/operation; unrelated authority stays usable. Projection progress SHALL record the minimum revision required for a fresh decision, including across restart. Provenance: directory principlesP4/P5 and ID001_AUDIT_FAULTS; conformance1.4,8.1.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_DURABILITY: enumerate every append, sync, authoritative-event and projection boundary in the implementation and inject a failure at each. Count the legs. Every answered grant/permission read equals replay, while unresolved reads name the grant/operation. Unrelated grant controls still succeed.
- GRANT_IDEMPOTENCE: lose acknowledgement after commit, retry identical ID/payload, reopen and retry again. One logical grant and one authorising event remain. A changed payload under the same ID refuses and changes neither projection.
- GRANT_AUDIT: independently verify a grant mutation receipt; tampering with actor, source grant, recipient, resource/actions, sequence or signature is rejected. A refusal never appears as a successful grant event.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/events.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/projection.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/recovery.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_faults.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_receipts.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C24 — Grant changes and their audit share one durable authoritative event; retries and uncertain outcomes preserve operation identity and replay-equivalent projections.

**Stories:**
- S10 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As an auditor, I want grant changes and retries tied to one durable signed operation, so restart or an uncertain reply cannot invent, lose or duplicate authority.

### R4: Enforce revocation, inherited expiry and current permission decisions

WHEN an ancestor is revoked or expires, THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse fresh exercise and further delegation through every grant derived from it. Independent grants to the same person or resource SHALL remain independent. Proposal under review: require a permission decision at least as fresh as the authoritative change, and refuse or await freshness rather than permit from a stale replica, unavailable engine or unresolved projection. The mechanism and choice must be settled before dispatch. Expiry SHALL be enforced at admission using the named clock, including inherited limits; a role edit or version move SHALL NOT renew a provisional grant. Reinstating a suspended identity SHALL recheck current ancestry and leases, never resurrect separately revoked or expired grants. Shared ancestor use/spend budgets are counted once by the broker in SECRETS-002 R9, never cloned into each descendant. The exact broader suspension policy remains the lifecycle ADR's, not a decision smuggled into this row. Conformance 2.5, 2.6, 3.3, 4.5.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_REVOKE: create a two-hop chain and an independently authorised sibling. A permitted action succeeds, then revoke the chain root and repeat exactly the same action for each descendant: every derived call refuses; the independent control succeeds.
- GRANT_EXPIRY: under a controlled clock, assert permit immediately before each relevant end boundary and refusal at/after it, including an earlier ancestor end. Neither editing a role nor selecting a newer role version extends the holding.
- GRANT_FRESHNESS: pause permission projection before applying a committed revoke; a caller presenting the required revision cannot obtain a permit from the old state. Resume projection and verify the named revoked decision after reopen.
- GRANT_REINSTATE: while an identity is suspended, revoke one grant and expire a second. After reinstatement both remain refused; only a third still-authorised control is usable. No renewal or issuance event is invented.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/revocation.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/expiry.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/permission.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_revocation.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_expiry.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C25 — Revocation stops derived authority while independent authority remains usable; the proposed revision-freshness mechanism is reviewed before dispatch.
- C26 — Inherited expiry and provisional end dates are enforced at admission; role changes and reinstatement cannot resurrect expired or revoked authority.

**Stories:**
- S8 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a responsible person, I want to give my agent a bounded part of my authority and revoke it, so the same action is allowed before revocation and refused after it.
- S11 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person granting temporary access, I want its end date and ancestor restrictions enforced, so role changes or reinstatement cannot silently extend it.

### R5: Expose one authenticated grant and explanation seam

THE SYSTEM SHALL expose typed operations for list/read, delegate, revoke and explain through the standalone identity server, all calling the same authority owner. API/tool access SHALL enforce the same checks as the UI; browser controls are presentation only. A why-permitted response SHALL identify actual authority path, responsible person, effective scope and policy revision; a why-refused response SHALL name the blocking condition without disclosing another identity's protected records. The reverse question, who can exercise this action on this resource, SHALL use the same evaluator and revision, with its own visibility permission. Incomplete pagination SHALL remain explicit. A last-use value reports observed use at named enforcement points; absence is not evidence of never-used. No live Cambium, Aion, Argus or Manifold is required. Conformance 8.1, 8.2, 8.4 and ADR-004.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_API_AUTH: unauthenticated, wrong issuer/subject, use-only and unauthorised-revoke requests are named refusals and create zero mutations. Exercise valid controls and count each route, rather than testing only button visibility.
- GRANT_EXPLAIN: the forward decision and reverse enumeration agree for the same resource/action/revision; paging returns every authorised holder exactly once and names continuation. Hidden private grants do not leak IDs, labels or existence to an unauthorised querier.
- GRANT_LAST_USED: an unobserved grant is labelled not seen; a recorded use reports its source/time; a missing reporting source is distinguished from a zero count. Reopen preserves the attribution.
- GRANT_STANDALONE: execute all operations against disposable local dependencies with other Ablative servers absent. Permission-engine outage is a named refusal, never an implicit standalone permit.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/src/grants.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/src/grant_contract.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/tests/grants.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/tests/grant_explanations.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity-server/src/routes.rs

**Checklist:**
- C27 — Typed browser/API/agent seams use one authenticated evaluator; forward and reverse explanations name the same authority path and revision without private-record leakage.
- C28 — Observed grant usage names its source and time; not seen is not reported as never used.

**Stories:**
- S9 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person or agent with use-only permission, I want the service to explain why I cannot pass it on; with explicit pass-on rights I want the same permitted operation available through UI and tools.
- S12 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As an authorised reviewer, I want to ask why this identity can act and who can reach a resource using the same current decision, without exposing records I may not inspect.

### R6: Implement the You and delegation screens from the server contract

THE SYSTEM SHALL render the accepted mock-up's You page and delegation form from the server's generated grant types and decisions. Show sign-in identities separately from service access, source grants, effective operations/resource, affirmative pass-on rights and inherited end boundary. The form SHALL explain refused choices the caller is allowed to discover; it SHALL NOT enumerate other people's private secrets merely to say no. Personal views are scoped to the signed-in person, while an independently authorised directory administrator may inspect the wider directory. A failed or uncertain mutation SHALL remain refused or pending, with the original operation ID, never an optimistic grant or a new retry. The access graph consumes the same explanation response; its rendering belongs to Archie's graph brief. No simulated confirmation timer or sample-data authority calculation ships. Conformance 1.3–1.5, 2.3–2.4, 8.1 and 8.4.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_SCREEN: using two test people and their agents, render the source grant, action/resource scope, pass-on decision and inherited expiry from fixture IDs. Switching the signed-in person changes the personal data; permitted administrator inspection remains possible through its separate route.
- GRANT_SCREEN_REFUSAL: a use-only source, excessive requested scope, people-only policy, expired ancestor and service outage are refused visibly with the server reason; the request count and record count prove no hidden mutation happened.
- GRANT_SCREEN_PENDING: withhold the acknowledgement after durable delegation. The page keeps the original operation pending, retries by that ID, and eventually shows one grant; it never changes to success on a timer.
- GRANT_CONFORMANCE: pin the accepted mock-up file hash and numbered conformance rows in the test evidence. Exercise keyboard operation and deep linking as well as API refusal parity; sample data and visual similarity alone are not a passing acceptance.

**Files:**
- create: surface/identity/src/features/grants/YouGrants.tsx
- create: surface/identity/src/features/grants/DelegateGrant.tsx
- create: surface/identity/src/features/grants/GrantExplanation.tsx
- create: surface/identity/tests/grants.test.tsx
- create: surface/identity/tests/acceptance/grants.spec.ts
- modify: surface/identity/src/routes.tsx
- modify: surface/identity/src/generated/index.ts

**Checklist:**
- C29 — The You and delegation screens show real server authority, separate service accounts from sign-in identities, and preserve personal versus administrator visibility.
- C30 — The accepted mock-up conformance is tested through actual requests, refusals, pending outcomes, keyboard paths and durable read-back rather than simulated success.

**Stories:**
- S8 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a responsible person, I want to give my agent a bounded part of my authority and revoke it, so the same action is allowed before revocation and refused after it.
- S9 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person or agent with use-only permission, I want the service to explain why I cannot pass it on; with explicit pass-on rights I want the same permitted operation available through UI and tools.
- S12 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As an authorised reviewer, I want to ask why this identity can act and who can reach a resource using the same current decision, without exposing records I may not inspect.

## Boundaries

- A missing file or unreviewed integration seam is a named dispatch blocker; do not silently expand a row wall or label an empty integration ready.
- No real credentials, live operator account mutation or production service writes in tests; use disposable local providers and permission fixtures.
- Every mutation seam is typed and generated; UI and agent callers use the same server checks. Do not infer authority from email, display name, mock-up data or absence of a deny flag.
- The same grant cannot acquire more authority through delegation, a secret handle, role migration, retries or restart. Use, delegation and permission to inspect another identity are distinct.
- The source/mock-up is a conformance specification, not implementation evidence. A test or source-only review never substitutes for the required live demonstration.
- No code in lys-core or published wire format changes in this brief. A capability format decision requires its own independent adversarial review before durable signing.
- Waffles owns board placement and workflow connection review. Create a blocked card with this exact brief path; do not move it into a dispatching status until its named blockers and row review are resolved.

## Verification

- From docs/: python3 "$DS2_METHOD/scripts/validate.py" design/directory and python3 "$DS2_METHOD/scripts/check-coverage.py" design/directory. Render with render-cluster.py and verify a second render is byte-identical.
- At implementation time run the repository battery from the exact revision: fmt, strict default/all-feature Clippy, feature-full tests and both rustdoc shapes. Run the granted/refused matrix and report each exercised leg, fault ordinal and unrun check.
- After the relevant screen row lands, demonstrate sign-in, agent registration, permitted action, source revocation and refusal to Tom using installed artifact hashes; record Melbourne time and exact authority/operation/receipt IDs. This human verification is not an automated acceptance criterion.
- Review the Cambium card: Card key resolves this exact JSON brief; project board rule connects to the supported deployed workflow; blocker/status prevents premature dispatch. No live test run or duplicate submission is used merely to inspect the configuration.

## Purpose

Three small items the 25 September grant-brief patch carries that main lacks after PR 6 (5593354) landed DIRECTORY-001 to DIRECTORY-006: the DIRECTORY-005 verification line for the frontend checks (R1), three design.json inventory rows for vendor/rauthy, crates/lys and docs/design/decisions.json beside the eight rows main lists (R2), and one design.json intention sentence recording that Cambium later uses this issuer keeping its participant ids, while the non-goal for rows 06 and 07 stands (R3). Main wins wherever the patch contradicts it on ADR ids and lifecycle; nothing here reopens a settled row. Documents only under docs/design/directory; no code; no new ADR; no change to any row's identifiers, estimates or dependency order.

## Task

Make the three document edits R1 to R3 on the documents as main holds them at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18 (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json:114-119, docs/design/directory/design.json:4 and docs/design/directory/design.json:580-613), re-render the cluster so each rendered twin matches its JSON, and pass the gate. Estimate: 1 focused implementer hour (R1 0.25, R2 0.5, R3 0.25), a document increment outside CN7's 48-hour ceiling, which stands unchanged; no row's estimate changes, DIRECTORY-005 keeps its 6 hours. Every path is relative to the repository root (CN3).

Ledger. Under the ruling of 26 September at 20:31 that a brief's ids are the next after main's highest and every open brief branch's, this brief is DIRECTORY-008 at docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-008.json and its roadmap row is RM-016 in docs/design/roadmap.json, appended after RM-015, which the audit receipt card's brief DIRECTORY-007 takes in the run fired beside this one; main's ledger ends at RM-010 (docs/design/roadmap.json:276) and RM-011 to RM-015 are taken on open brief branches, so RM-016 is appended as the next row with every row main holds unchanged. It records no new decision: docs/design/decisions.json is not touched. Per the settled answer B1 (round 1 of run a68a7767, 22:49): RM-016 is the brief's own ledger entry, which every brief on main has, written by the brief method the gate runs, as the brief file is written under docs/design/directory/briefs; the boundary 'documents only under docs/design/directory' governs the work R1 to R3 do when built, not the brief's own files; RM-016 is appended with every row main holds unchanged, and no other file outside docs/design/directory changes. The two structure rows for this brief's own files in design.json are the method's listing of the brief, as DIRECTORY-006's rows are (docs/design/directory/design.json:414-423), and are written on the brief branch, not by the build.

Coverage. C1, C3, C6 and S2 are claimed by DIRECTORY-001, which wrote these documents, and by this brief, which completes them with the three items; the split is noted here, as check-coverage.py allows, and is reported as a warning, not a failure.

Dev note. The build starts from the main this brief lands on, which may be later than 1756688 if DIRECTORY-007 lands first; the counts in R1 to R3 are stated against 1756688 and hold, because that brief's words touch neither DIRECTORY-005's verification nor design.json's inventory or intention. Read the four files first. Make each JSON edit as an append that keeps every existing member byte for byte: json.load, append, json.dump with indent=2 and ensure_ascii=False plus one trailing newline reproduces main's formatting exactly (checked at 1756688 for both files by a round trip). Then run python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory and commit the rendered DESIGN.md and DIRECTORY-005.md beside their JSON; the gate compares a fresh render against the committed markdown byte for byte. Run bash scripts/design/gate.sh last and commit the four files by exact path.

## Requirements

### R1: Add the frontend verification line to DIRECTORY-005

THE SYSTEM SHALL append to the verification array of docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json:114-119, four entries at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, the fourth being the ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE hold point) one fifth and last entry, exactly: 'Frontend checks pass with strict types and the generated API schema, with negative and crash-boundary tests.' The four entries main holds SHALL stay byte for byte and in their order. No other member of DIRECTORY-005 changes: not its id, depends_on, blocked_by, checklist, stories, design_anchor, purpose, task with its 6-hour estimate, requirements or boundaries. THE SYSTEM SHALL re-render docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md with python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory so its Verification section (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md:103-108 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18) lists the five entries.

**Acceptance:**
- From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json'))['verification']))" prints 5 (it prints 4 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18), and the first four entries equal, string for string, the four that git show 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18:docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json holds.
- From the repository root: rg -c 'strict types and the generated API schema' docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json prints 1, and the same command over docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md prints 1; both print nothing at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.
- From the repository root, on the build branch: git diff --no-ext-diff --numstat <base>..HEAD -- docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json prints 2 added and 1 deleted (the new entry's line and the fourth entry's line gaining its trailing comma), where <base> is the commit the build started from.
- From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json')); print(d['task'].count('6 focused implementer hours'), d['depends_on'])" prints 1 ['DIRECTORY-004'], as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md

**Checklist:**
- C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task.
- C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

#### R1 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Accept 1: met. The verification array has 5 entries, and the first four were left untouched by the append (the dump round trip is byte-identical, checked before editing). Accept 2: met. rg -c prints 1 for docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json (line 119) and 1 for DIRECTORY-005.md (line 109). Accept 3: met. The working-tree git diff --numstat for DIRECTORY-005.json is '2 1': the new line plus the fourth entry gaining its comma. Accept 4: met. The check prints 1 ['DIRECTORY-004'].
- Deviation: I ran python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory once, because R1 to R3 require the re-render and it is the only way to produce the rendered twins. I ran no other listed check, build, lint or test, and made no commit, as instructed.
- Files changed:
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json` — The verification array now holds five entries. The fifth, at line 119, is 'Frontend checks pass with strict types and the generated API schema, with negative and crash-boundary tests.' Every other member is unchanged.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md` — Re-rendered. The Verification section lists the five entries, with the new one at line 109.

### R2: Add the three inventory rows beside what main lists

THE SYSTEM SHALL append three rows to the inventory array of docs/design/directory/design.json (docs/design/directory/design.json:580-613, eight rows at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, ending with docs/design/identity/RAUTHY-BASELINE.md at docs/design/directory/design.json:606 and docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md at docs/design/directory/design.json:610), after the eight and in this order, each with its path and a note of what exists there at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18: (1) path 'vendor/rauthy', note 'the maintained Rauthy fork (ADR-009), the git submodule pinned at dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662, the upstream v0.36.2 commit the ablative branch was created from; DIRECTORY-004 moves the pin (structure row); read here, never changed by a document row'; (2) path 'crates/lys', note 'the lys CLI crate: Cargo.toml, src/main.rs, src/cli.rs and src/commands/ (attest, ca, key, log, inspect, files); DIRECTORY-002 adds src/identity/ and the identity subcommand to it (structure rows)'; (3) path 'docs/design/decisions.json', note 'the project decision ledger, ADR-001 to ADR-018 at main, holding the decisions this cluster cites (ADR-003, ADR-004, ADR-005, ADR-007 to ADR-011); DIRECTORY-001 recorded that it gained the identity decisions (structure row); read here, never changed by a document row'. The eight rows main lists SHALL stay byte for byte and in their order. No structure row, principle, goal, non-goal, constraint or gate leg changes. THE SYSTEM SHALL re-render docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md with python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory so its Inventory section (docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md:167-176 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18) lists the eleven rows.

**Acceptance:**

### R3: Record the Cambium direction in the intention while the non-goal stands

THE SYSTEM SHALL append one sentence to the intention of docs/design/directory/design.json (docs/design/directory/design.json:4 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, one sentence ending 'every identity change.'), after one space, exactly: 'Cambium later uses this issuer, keeping its participant ids (rows 06 and 07); that direction is recorded here while rows 06 and 07 stay the non-goal recorded below, and this sentence promises neither row.' The non-goal for rows 06 and 07 (docs/design/directory/design.json:63-66, text 'Rows 06 (connect Cambium) and 07 (gate, install and demonstrate the release)' with its reason) SHALL stay byte for byte; no other member of the intention, and no goal, principle, non-goal, structure row, constraint or gate leg, changes. THE SYSTEM SHALL re-render docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md with python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory so its Intention section (docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md:11-13 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18) carries the sentence.

**Acceptance:**
- From the repository root: rg -c 'keeping its participant ids' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 1 and the same command over docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md prints 1; both print nothing at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.

The intention starts with the operator sentence and ends with 'and this sentence promises neither row.' Accept 3: met. The non-goals were not edited, so the Rows 06/07 text is still present and non_goals still has 11 entries (measured). Accept 4: met. goals, principles and constraints measure 5, 9 and 12.
- Deviation: (none)
- Files changed:
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/design.json` — At line 4 the intention now ends with one space and then the exact Cambium sentence. The non-goals were not changed.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md` — Re-rendered. The Intention section (line 13) carries the sentence.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling. — The outcome now records the Cambium direction, and the non-goal is kept.

- Acceptance verdicts:
  - [x] From the repository root: rg -c 'keeping its participant ids' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 1 and the same command over docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md prints 1; both print nothing at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18. — Prints 1 for design.json and 1 for DESIGN.md.
  - [x] From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; i=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json'))['intention']; print(i.startswith('An operator installs the identity product without Cambium or Manifold, signs in,') and i.endswith('and this sentence promises neither row.'))" prints True. — Prints True. The intention also equals the base intention + ' ' + the exact spec sentence (True).
  - [x] From the repository root: rg -c 'Rows 06 \(connect Cambium\) and 07 \(gate, install and demonstrate the release\)' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 1, as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, and python3 -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json'))['non_goals']))" prints 11, as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18. — rg -c prints 1, and len(non_goals) is 11. non_goals equals the base value (True).
  - [x] From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json')); print(len(d['goals']), len(d['principles']), len(d['constraints']))" prints 5 9 12, as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18. — Prints 5 9 12. Against HEAD, only intention and inventory differ in design.json.

## Boundaries

- Documents only under docs/design/directory: the build changes exactly the four files R1 to R3 name (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json, docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md, docs/design/directory/design.json, docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md) and nothing else; no code; no file under crates/, surface/, deploy/, vendor/, scripts/ or tests/; docs/design/decisions.json is not touched either, narrower than CN1.
- No new ADR: docs/design/decisions.json is unchanged; this brief's design_anchor cites decisions that exist at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18 and it records no decision.
- No change to any row's identifiers, estimates or dependency order: every brief id, roadmap id, ADR id, C, S, R and ID001 identifier, every estimate (DIRECTORY-005's 6 hours, CN7's ceiling) and every depends_on array stays as main holds it.
- Main wins wherever the 25 September patch contradicts it on ADR ids and lifecycle: nothing from the patch beyond the three items is carried, and no settled row reopens.
- The non-goal for rows 06 and 07 stands: the intention sentence records a direction and promises no row, no Cambium cluster and no cross-repository arrangement.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- The roadmap row RM-016 in docs/design/roadmap.json is this brief's own ledger entry, written on the brief branch by this brief and never by the build; per the settled answer B1 of 22:49 it stands outside the 'documents only under docs/design/directory' boundary, which governs the build's work (R1 to R3). The build changes no file outside docs/design/directory.
- No credential, token or key value is written in any document.
- No row is dispatched until this brief is signed off.

## Verification

- From the repository root: bash scripts/design/gate.sh exits 0 (scripts/design/gate.sh: validate.py over docs/design/decisions.json, docs/design/project.json and every cluster, check-coverage.py over every cluster, and render-cluster.py into a temporary copy compared byte for byte with the committed markdown).
- From the repository root, on the build branch: git diff --no-ext-diff --name-only <base>..HEAD prints exactly four paths, docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md, docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json, docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md and docs/design/directory/design.json, where <base> is the commit the build started from; git diff --no-ext-diff --name-only <base>..HEAD -- . ':!docs/design/directory' prints nothing.
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0; the coverage report may list C1, C3, C6 and S2 as claimed by DIRECTORY-001 and DIRECTORY-008, a warning whose split this brief's task notes, and lists no failure.
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory run a second time changes no file (git status --porcelain docs/design/directory prints nothing after it).
