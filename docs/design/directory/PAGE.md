# directory — what was asked, what it means, and what was written

## The words, as they were typed

Conformance row 1.2 says a sign-in identity is never lent to or held by an agent. A sign-in identity is a person's link to a provider, such as a Google or GitHub account, through which that person signs in. IDENTITY-001 was to state this and never did, and no brief tests it. The directory holds sign-in identities beside people (DIRECTORY-004 links two providers to one person) and gives grants to agents (DIRECTORY-006), so the refusal belongs at the point where anything would attach a sign-in identity to an agent.

The directory refuses, by name, every act that would give an agent a sign-in identity: linking a provider account to an agent, delegating a grant whose source is a sign-in identity, and issuing any credential to an agent that is derived from a person's sign-in session. The refusal names the act, the agent and the sign-in identity, and states that sign-in identities belong to people only. Nothing an agent holds or presents is ever a person's sign-in session or token. The "cannot give" list of row 2.4 shows sign-in identities with the reason "sign-in identity".

Acceptance is that linking a provider account to an agent is refused by name; that delegating from a sign-in identity to an agent is refused by name; that a credential request for an agent that presents a person's sign-in token is refused by name; that each refusal writes nothing to the directory; and that no agent record in the directory ever carries a sign-in identity, checked by one test over the store after all three refusals. This brief names row 1.2 as the row it passes.

It waits for DIRECTORY-004 and DIRECTORY-006 to land, each checked by a command a stranger can run against lys main. Filed by Archie, lead for the identity line, on 27 September 2026, against lys main 7b536253.

Rulings of the lead, Archie, given on 27 September 2026 to the run ea580795-f9fa-4284-99e5-1f7cce6b37c4 in answer to its rounds. That run took every answer and then failed before writing, when the account pool refused every session. They are settled here, and the author reopens none of them.

The exception stays, because it is Tom's ruling and this brief does not overturn it. The brief states it as the one named exception, citing STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:43 and :167 and PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md:18. The harness login token reaches a seat's process under that ruling, and it never passes through anything lys issues, links or delegates. The rule governs everything lys itself gives an agent. The token is not redefined, and the brief does not pretend it is something other than what it is. Answered by Archie, lead for the identity line.

No seam that exists only to refuse. The directory enforces the two acts it owns, linking a provider account to an agent and delegating a grant whose source is a sign-in identity, each refused by name with an acceptance line. Issuing credentials is the broker's, so the third refusal is a rule the broker enforces. This brief states it and names it as a finding against SECRETS-002, with the acceptance line that the broker refuses to issue an agent any credential derived from a person's sign-in session, to be carried by the broker's card. The brief says that row 1.2 is met in full only when that line passes. Answered by Archie.

Only that one exists. A refusal returned to anyone other than the identity's owner or a directory administrator names the act, the agent and the fact that a sign-in identity is involved, and states that sign-in identities belong to people only. It never shows the provider or the subject, as DIRECTORY-006 R5 requires. The owner and administrators see the provider and subject. Acceptance lines cover both views. Answered by Archie.

Only a person's account. A sign-in identity is a provider account linked to a person in the directory, and only that is refused. An agent's own machine account, bound to the agent and to no person, is a service account under row 1.3's separate list, and registering it as the agent's issuer-subject binding under DIRECTORY-003 R1 is allowed. A provider account already linked to a person is refused for an agent by name. Acceptance lines cover an agent's own account accepted and a person's linked account refused. Answered by Archie.

The server's reason is this brief's, and the screen is row 2.4's. Apollo's card jAfmblAP carries the cannot-give list with its four reasons, sign-in identity among them, on the delegation screen. This brief asserts that the server returns the reason 'sign-in identity' for such an entry, and names jAfmblAP as where a person sees it. No screen work is duplicated here. Answered by Archie.

Correction of the lead, Archie, given on 28 September 2026 after reading the brief written by run 9c512bc3 at d8beac4a, which is not signed off. The brief id DIRECTORY-009 and the checklist ids C31 to C36 and story ids S13 to S17 it took are held with other text on brief/directory/lifecycle-hand, on its card-gate branches, and on six open directory drafts, so the brief, its checklist items and its stories take the next free ids past main and every open brief, draft, card and hand branch, read with git ls-remote and git show immediately before writing, and every cross-reference follows. The words' first sentences are carried as written: a sign-in identity is a person's link to a provider, such as a Google or GitHub account, through which that person signs in, and the sentence naming DIRECTORY-004 and DIRECTORY-006 stays whole. The ruling sentence that the brief does not pretend the token is something other than what it is stays as a sentence, and the sentence naming Apollo's card jAfmblAP with its four reasons stays as written. Each blocked_by entry states one command a stranger runs against lys main with its expected output, including the DIRECTORY-003 manifest entry and the DIRECTORY-004 fork-side check. The verification line runs cargo fmt, never a fmt check, and states the exit code expected of each command. Nothing else in the brief changes. Answered by Archie, lead for the identity line.

## What the survey found, and its angles

The words ask for a directory brief, filed by Archie, that makes conformance row 1.2 testable. A sign-in identity (a provider account linked to a person) is never lent to or held by an agent. The directory refuses, by name and with no write, the two acts it owns: linking a person's provider account to an agent, and delegating a grant whose source is a sign-in identity. The third refusal (a credential derived from a person's sign-in session) is stated as a finding against SECRETS-002 for the broker's card to carry. The server returns the reason 'sign-in identity' for row 2.4's cannot-give list, and the screen stays with Apollo's card jAfmblAP. The brief keeps Tom's harness-login-token exception as the one named exception, waits for DIRECTORY-004 and DIRECTORY-006 to land, and takes fresh ids past every open ref.

### What the tree holds

- `docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md` — Row 1.2 (line 16) is the row this brief passes, and its Brief column still says 'IDENTITY-001 (amend: state it)', owner Waffles. Row 1.3 (line 17) is the separate service-account list that the ruling puts an agent's own machine account under. Row 2.4 (line 28) holds the four cannot-give reasons, 'sign-in identity' among them.
- `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json` — R1 defines the external issuer-subject bindings for people and agents and says registering an agent 'SHALL NOT ... manufacture a human login for it'. The binding is where 'linking a provider account to an agent' actually lands, and where the ruling allows an agent's own machine account. R3 names the configured administrator, who sees provider and subject. R4 is the link-audit receiver through which the directory learns which provider accounts are linked to people.
- `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-004.json` — The two-providers-to-one-person link lives in the Rauthy fork (vendor/rauthy, pin moves under R1). ID001_LINK_REFUSAL refuses an already-owned provider identity only inside Rauthy, so it cannot see directory agent bindings. The fork-side blocked_by check is the vendor/rauthy pin plus the ID001_LINK_* identifiers under vendor/rauthy/tests/identity_links.
- `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-006.json` — R2 (grants/admission.rs, lineage.rs, authority.rs) is the admission point where a delegation whose source is a sign-in identity is refused before any mutation. R3 says 'A refusal never appears as a successful grant event'. R5's why-refused response must not disclose another identity's protected records, which is the basis for hiding provider and subject from non-owners. R6/GRANT_SCREEN_REFUSAL lists use-only, excessive scope, people-only, expired ancestor and outage, but not 'sign-in identity'.
- `docs/design/secrets/briefs/SECRETS-002.json` — The broker's brief. R4 already keeps a provider sign-in identity and an OAuth service grant as distinct records (SEC_OAUTH_ACCOUNT). R5 is the seat login at spawn, citing STATEMENT:43 and :167, which is the exception the words keep. The finding that the broker refuses to issue an agent any credential derived from a person's sign-in session is named against this brief.
- `docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md` — Line 43 (the seat's own login: the Claude Code OAuth token reaches the process at spawn) and line 167 (step 3 carries the login exception) are the citations for the one named exception.
- `docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md` — Line 18, step 4: 'The login exception stands: the harness login token still reaches its process.' This is the third citation the ruling names.
- `docs/design/directory/design.json` — The cluster design this brief continues. It gains structure rows for the new brief's files. CN9 requires an exact file manifest for new modules. CN12 says not to dispatch a dependency-blocked brief.
- `docs/design/directory/checklist.json` — C1–C30 on main. The brief's new checklist items take the next free ids past every open ref, not C31 onward.
- `docs/design/directory/stories.json` — S1–S12 on main. The new stories take the next free ids past every open ref, not S13 onward.
- `scripts/design/gate.sh` — The design leg the brief must pass: validate.py, check-coverage.py and render-cluster.py compared byte for byte.
- `Cargo.toml` — The workspace members list (6 crates, no lys-identity) is where the DIRECTORY-003 manifest entry the blocked_by command checks for will appear.
- `vendor/rauthy` — The submodule is still pinned at dd61ac3c (upstream v0.36.2). The DIRECTORY-004 fork-side check reads it.
- `docs/design/roadmap.json` — RM-001 (briefed) lists DIRECTORY-001 to 005. The work needs a roadmap row to carry it.

### What was already decided

- directory/DESIGN P2 — Everything is pegged to a human authority; exercising and delegating are separate grants.
- directory/DESIGN P3 — Registration issues no Rauthy login, runtime credential or capability certificate. This is the nearest existing statement to row 1.2, and it is about registration only.
- directory/DESIGN P4/P5 — One signed event is the change and its audit, and there is no success before durable evidence. A refusal therefore writes nothing, and an uncertain link state is not answered as current.
- directory/DESIGN CN1 — The cluster's document constraint: nothing outside docs/design/directory and decisions.json is changed by the document rows. CONFORMANCE.md and SECRETS-002 are outside it.
- directory/DESIGN CN9 — A wholly new module needs an exact reviewed file manifest before its row starts, and a file outside the wall stops the row.
- directory/DESIGN CN12 — DIRECTORY-006 is not executable until the 002/003 foundations are implemented. Do not dispatch from a schema-valid but dependency-blocked brief.
- DIRECTORY-003 R1 — Issuer-subject bindings for people and agents. An agent registration never manufactures a human login.
- DIRECTORY-004 R1 — Provider linking happens in the Rauthy fork. ID001_LINK_REFUSAL refuses an already-owned provider identity inside Rauthy.
- DIRECTORY-006 R2 — People-only authority refuses agents even when the person owns the agent. Refusals happen before any mutation.
- DIRECTORY-006 R5 — A why-refused response names the blocking condition without disclosing another identity's protected records.
- DIRECTORY-006 R6 — The You page shows sign-in identities separately from service access. The screen refusal list lacks a 'sign-in identity' reason.
- SECRETS-002 R4 — A provider sign-in identity and an OAuth service-access grant stay distinct records, and sign-in credentials never rebind a service grant.
- SECRETS-002 R5 — The seat's own login token goes into its environment at spawn. It is the one place a credential reaches the process (STATEMENT:43, :167).
- CONFORMANCE 1.2 / 1.3 / 2.4 — Sign-in identities are never lent to or held by an agent. Service accounts are a separate list. The cannot-give list shows the reason 'sign-in identity'.
- ADR-003 — Grants are pegged to a person, and the agent holds an explicit subset.
- ADR-009 — Linking is changed in our Rauthy fork, pinned as vendor/rauthy.
- ADR-011 — Proposed: a registered agent has no grants and no credential handle. Having a credential is a fact beside the state.
- ADR-001 — The broker holds credentials behind handles, so credential issuance is the broker's, not the directory's.

### What was measured

- Briefs in docs/design/directory/briefs on the local main (7b53625): 7 (DIRECTORY-001 to 006, and 008)
- Briefs whose text states conformance row 1.2 or 'never lent': 0 across IDENTITY-001, DIRECTORY-001..008, SECRETS-001/002
- Occurrences of 'sign-in identit' per brief: IDENTITY-001: 0; DIRECTORY-001..005, 008: 0; DIRECTORY-006: 1 (R6); SECRETS-002: 1 (R4)
- Checklist and story ids in the directory cluster on main: C1–C30 (30 items), S1–S12 (12 stories)
- Refs on origin (git ls-remote): 336; the objects of 125 are local and 211 are not
- Highest ids seen across the 125 locally readable refs: brief file DIRECTORY-034, checklist C278, story S123 (211 refs unread, so this is a floor, not the answer)
- Run 9c512bc3's brief commit d8beac4a: not present locally (git cat-file fails)
- origin/main versus the words' base 7b536253: a426b9a5 is 6 commits ahead, 19 files changed, none under docs/design
- crates/lys-identity and crates/lys-identity-server on origin/main: absent; workspace has 6 members (lys, lys-anchor, lys-anchor-cli, lys-core, lys-home, lys-log-store)
- surface/ and deploy/ on origin/main: absent
- vendor/rauthy pin: dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662 (upstream v0.36.2, unmoved, so DIRECTORY-004 has not landed)
- CONFORMANCE.md: 118 lines; row 1.2 at line 16, 1.3 at line 17, 2.4 at line 28
- Directory design documents: DESIGN.md 196 lines, design.json 770 lines, checklist.json 185 lines, stories.json 83 lines
- Design gate on the local tree (validate.py + check-coverage.py, directory): 10 documents valid, coverage clean, 3 multi-claim story warnings (S1, S2, S3)
- DIRECTORY-006 estimate: 17 hours (R1 2, R2 3, R3 4, R4 3, R5 2, R6 3)
- Hits for Apollo's card jAfmblAP in this tree: 0
- Login-exception citations: STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:43 and :167, PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md:18, each read and each stating the harness login token reaches its process

### What it means for the other projects

- cambium — Apollo's card jAfmblAP carries the cannot-give screen with the 'sign-in identity' reason, fed by the server reason this brief asserts. The broker's finding (refuse any agent credential derived from a person's sign-in session) lands on SECRETS-002's card, whose door-owned files live in the cambium checkout. The seat login at spawn (SECRETS-002 R5) is untouched.
- aion — The brief is carried through the aion chain (brief_card, sign-off, card_build_v3, src_pr, src_land). The harness login token that aion's workers put into a seat stays the named exception and is not redefined. No aion change.
- method — The brief must validate against the brief schema copied from method at 3c3bac7 (scripts/design/SOURCE.md). No method change.

### The decisions it stands on

- ADR-003 (honour) — A sign-in identity is the person's own root. Keeping it out of every agent grant keeps grants pegged to a person without lending the person themselves.
- ADR-009 (honour) — Provider linking stays in the maintained fork. This brief changes no fork file and only reads the pin as a blocker.
- ADR-011 (honour) — A registered agent holds no credential handle, and holding a sign-in identity would give it one by another name.
- ADR-001 (honour) — Credential issuance belongs to the broker behind handles, so the third refusal is the broker's rule, not a directory seam.
- ADR-004 (honour) — The refusals and their tests run with the directory standing alone, with no Cambium or Manifold.
- ADR-007 (honour) — The start command already carries no credential value. This brief adds that nothing lys gives an agent is a person's sign-in session.
-  (new) — Record as a decision that a sign-in identity belongs to a person only: lys never links, delegates or issues from it to an agent, and the harness login token (STATEMENT:43, :167, PROVISIONING:18) is the one named exception outside lys. Today the rule sits only in a conformance row.

### What it requires

- Binding a provider account already linked to a person as an agent's issuer-subject binding is refused. The refusal names the act, the agent and the sign-in identity, and states that sign-in identities belong to people only.
- Delegating to an agent a grant whose source is a sign-in identity is refused by name at DIRECTORY-006's admission, before any mutation.
- Registering an agent's own machine account (bound to no person) as its issuer-subject binding under DIRECTORY-003 R1 succeeds, with its own acceptance line.
- Each refusal writes nothing: the directory's event count, projections and records are equal before and after it.
- One test over the store, after the refusals, finds no agent record carrying a provider account linked to a person.
- A refusal seen by anyone other than the identity's owner or a directory administrator names the act, the agent and that a sign-in identity is involved, and never shows the provider or the subject. The owner and administrators see provider and subject. Both views have acceptance lines.
- The server returns the reason 'sign-in identity' for a sign-in identity in the cannot-give list, and names jAfmblAP as where a person sees it.
- The brief states the broker finding against SECRETS-002, with its acceptance line, and says row 1.2 is met in full only when that line passes.
- The brief states the harness login token as the one named exception, citing STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:43 and :167 and PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md:18.
- The brief names conformance row 1.2 as the row it passes.
- The brief, checklist and story ids are the next free ones past main and every open brief, draft, card and hand branch, read with git ls-remote and git show immediately before writing, and every cross-reference follows.
- Each blocked_by entry is one command a stranger runs against lys main, with its expected output, covering DIRECTORY-003's manifest entry, DIRECTORY-004's fork-side check and DIRECTORY-006's landing.
- The verification line runs cargo fmt (not --check) and states the expected exit code of each command.
- sh scripts/design/gate.sh exits 0 with the new brief, checklist items, stories and structure rows.

### What must not change

- The harness login token is not redefined, and the brief does not pretend it is something other than what it is.
- No seam exists only to refuse. The directory enforces only the acts it owns.
- No screen work: the cannot-give screen is jAfmblAP's.
- SECRETS-002 and the door's files are not edited by this brief. The finding is carried by the broker's card.
- No file in vendor/rauthy or the ablative-io/rauthy fork changes.
- No published lys wire format or lys-core cryptography changes, and lys/delegation/v1 is not reinterpreted.
- The IDENTITY-001 files stay as the revision-5 record.
- The words' first sentences, the sentence naming DIRECTORY-004 and DIRECTORY-006, the token sentence and the jAfmblAP sentence are carried as written.
- A refusal never shows provider or subject to anyone but the owner or a directory administrator.

### What we must put in place first

- DIRECTORY-003 landed: crates/lys-identity and crates/lys-identity-server with a reviewed manifest, issuer-subject bindings and the link-audit receiver (none exist on origin/main a426b9a5).
- DIRECTORY-004 landed: vendor/rauthy moved off dd61ac3c to a gated ablative commit with ID001_LINK_* tests. This needs the fork-owned brief, which does not yet exist.
- DIRECTORY-006 landed: grants/admission.rs and the grant explanation seam on main.
- A fresh read of every remote ref's objects (211 of 336 are not local) to find the next free brief, checklist and story ids immediately before writing.

### The risks

- Id collision again: this survey could read only 125 of 336 refs, and the ids seen already reach DIRECTORY-034, C278 and S123.
- The chain dispatches a schema-valid but dependency-blocked brief (CN12). All three dependencies are unlanded, and DIRECTORY-004 waits on a fork brief that does not exist.
- A race: a person's link audit pending in Rauthy's outbox is not yet in the directory projection, so an agent binding of that account is admitted.
- Reverse order: an agent's own machine account later linked by a person leaves an agent carrying a sign-in identity that no refusal caught.
- Refusal text leaks the provider or subject to a non-owner through an error message, log line or explanation response.
- A zero-write assertion that counts only one store (for example events but not projections) passes while a hidden write happens elsewhere.
- The file wall cannot be exact until DIRECTORY-003/006 manifests land, so the brief may name paths that move (CN9).
- The broker line is never carried because SECRETS-002's card is in another board and repository, leaving row 1.2 only partly met with no one tracking it.
- Heavy gates must run on Dean's laptop, so a local-only green is not the gate.

### Still open

- Two of the three refusals are the directory's and the third is the broker's. Should the one store test run after the two directory refusals, or wait until the broker's refusal also exists? The sentence of the words it stands on: "Acceptance is that linking a provider account to an agent is refused by name; that delegating from a sign-in identity to an agent is refused by name; that a credential request for an agent that presents a person's sign-in token is refused by name; that each refusal writes nothing to the directory; and that no agent record in the directory ever carries a sign-in identity, checked by one test over the store after all three refusals.". Why only the lead can settle it: The ruling moves the third refusal to the broker (SECRETS-002, unbuilt, in the door's repository), so this brief's own test cannot run a broker refusal. What passes, and when row 1.2 counts as tested, depends on the answer.
- An agent's own machine account may be bound to it. If a person later links that same provider account to themselves in Rauthy, which act is refused: the person's link, the agent's binding (removed or flagged), or neither? The sentence of the words it stands on: "A provider account already linked to a person is refused for an agent by name.". Why only the lead can settle it: The words and rulings cover only one order: the person's link exists first. In the reverse order the agent would come to carry a sign-in identity. DIRECTORY-004's ID001_LINK_REFUSAL refuses only accounts already owned inside Rauthy, and it cannot see directory agent bindings (DIRECTORY-003 R1). What a person sees when linking an account an agent already holds changes with the answer.
- Does the cannot-give list show sign-in identities with the reason 'sign-in identity' only when the recipient is an agent, or for every recipient, including another person? The sentence of the words it stands on: "The "cannot give" list of row 2.4 shows sign-in identities with the reason "sign-in identity".". Why only the lead can settle it: Row 1.2 and the words speak only of agents. Row 2.4 is unqualified, and DIRECTORY-006 R2 delegates to both recipient kinds. What a person sees in the delegation form when giving to another person differs.

### The units beyond the first

- SECRETS-002: the broker refuses to issue an agent any credential derived from a person's sign-in session — Issuing credentials is the broker's, in the door's repository and on the broker's card. Row 1.2 is met in full only when this line passes.
- jAfmblAP: the cannot-give list shows sign-in identities with the reason 'sign-in identity' on the delegation screen — Screen work belongs to Apollo's card and is explicitly not duplicated here.
- CONFORMANCE.md row 1.2: point its Brief column at the new directory brief — The row still names 'IDENTITY-001 (amend: state it)', and the file sits outside the directory cluster's documents.
- Fork-side refusal of a person linking a provider account already bound to an agent — Only if the lead rules the reverse order is refused. The check would live in the Rauthy fork or the link receiver, outside this brief's wall.
- Decision record: sign-in identities belong to people only, with the harness login token as the one exception — The rule currently lives only in a conformance row. An ADR is its own ledger change.

### The smallest complete shape

One directory brief at the next free id, with its checklist items, stories and design.json structure rows, rendered and gate-clean. Its requirements: (1) refuse by name, with no write, binding a person-linked provider account to an agent at the DIRECTORY-003 binding seam, while accepting an agent's own machine account; (2) refuse by name, with no write, delegating a sign-in-identity-sourced grant to an agent at DIRECTORY-006 admission; (3) return the 'sign-in identity' cannot-give reason with the owner/administrator versus other-caller views; (4) one store test that no agent record carries a sign-in identity. It states the harness-login exception and the SECRETS-002 finding, and it is blocked by stranger-runnable commands for DIRECTORY-003, 004 and 006. Built later through the chain as one card once those land.

## The roadmap row

- **RM-065** — Refuse by name every act that would give a sign-in identity to an agent (conformance row 1.2) (feature, idea)
- Summary: States and tests conformance row 1.2: a sign-in identity, a person's link to a provider through which that person signs in, is never lent to or held by an agent. The directory refuses by name linking a person's provider account to an agent and delegating from a sign-in identity, each of those two refusals writing nothing, and refuses by name a person's link of an account it already binds to an agent, recording that refusal as one signed history entry; one counted test over the store after the two directory refusals finds no agent record carrying a sign-in identity. An agent's own machine account stays allowed. The broker's refusal of credentials derived from a person's sign-in session is recorded as a finding against SECRETS-002; row 1.2 is met in full only when it passes.
- Asked by: tom on 2026-09-27T14:22:00+10:00
- Context: The identity line's card for conformance row 1.2, filed against lys main 7b536253. The lead's rulings of 27 September, the correction of 28 September after reading run 9c512bc3's brief at d8beac4a, and the lead's three answers to this brief's survey (the store test runs after the two directory refusals; a person's later link of an agent's own account is refused and the agent's binding stands; the cannot-give reason is returned for every recipient) and the answer to its author (the reverse-order refusal names the agent to the agent's responsible person and administrators, in the directory's history, and withholds it from the person trying to link) are carried into DIRECTORY-038 as settled.
- Quote: Conformance row 1.2 says a sign-in identity is never lent to or held by an agent. A sign-in identity is a person's link to a provider, such as a Google or GitHub account, through which that person signs in. IDENTITY-001 was to state this and never did, and no brief tests it. The directory holds sign-in identities beside people (DIRECTORY-004 links two providers to one person) and gives grants to agents (DIRECTORY-006), so the refusal belongs at the point where anything would attach a sign-in identity to an agent.

The directory refuses, by name, every act that would give an agent a sign-in identity: linking a provider account to an agent, delegating a grant whose source is a sign-in identity, and issuing any credential to an agent that is derived from a person's sign-in session. The refusal names the act, the agent and the sign-in identity, and states that sign-in identities belong to people only. Nothing an agent holds or presents is ever a person's sign-in session or token. The "cannot give" list of row 2.4 shows sign-in identities with the reason "sign-in identity".

Acceptance is that linking a provider account to an agent is refused by name; that delegating from a sign-in identity to an agent is refused by name; that a credential request for an agent that presents a person's sign-in token is refused by name; that each refusal writes nothing to the directory; and that no agent record in the directory ever carries a sign-in identity, checked by one test over the store after all three refusals. This brief names row 1.2 as the row it passes.

It waits for DIRECTORY-004 and DIRECTORY-006 to land, each checked by a command a stranger can run against lys main. Filed by Archie, lead for the identity line, on 27 September 2026, against lys main 7b536253.

Rulings of the lead, Archie, given on 27 September 2026 to the run ea580795-f9fa-4284-99e5-1f7cce6b37c4 in answer to its rounds. That run took every answer and then failed before writing, when the account pool refused every session. They are settled here, and the author reopens none of them.

The exception stays, because it is Tom's ruling and this brief does not overturn it. The brief states it as the one named exception, citing STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:43 and :167 and PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md:18. The harness login token reaches a seat's process under that ruling, and it never passes through anything lys issues, links or delegates. The rule governs everything lys itself gives an agent. The token is not redefined, and the brief does not pretend it is something other than what it is. Answered by Archie, lead for the identity line.

No seam that exists only to refuse. The directory enforces the two acts it owns, linking a provider account to an agent and delegating a grant whose source is a sign-in identity, each refused by name with an acceptance line. Issuing credentials is the broker's, so the third refusal is a rule the broker enforces. This brief states it and names it as a finding against SECRETS-002, with the acceptance line that the broker refuses to issue an agent any credential derived from a person's sign-in session, to be carried by the broker's card. The brief says that row 1.2 is met in full only when that line passes. Answered by Archie.

Only that one exists. A refusal returned to anyone other than the identity's owner or a directory administrator names the act, the agent and the fact that a sign-in identity is involved, and states that sign-in identities belong to people only. It never shows the provider or the subject, as DIRECTORY-006 R5 requires. The owner and administrators see the provider and subject. Acceptance lines cover both views. Answered by Archie.

Only a person's account. A sign-in identity is a provider account linked to a person in the directory, and only that is refused. An agent's own machine account, bound to the agent and to no person, is a service account under row 1.3's separate list, and registering it as the agent's issuer-subject binding under DIRECTORY-003 R1 is allowed. A provider account already linked to a person is refused for an agent by name. Acceptance lines cover an agent's own account accepted and a person's linked account refused. Answered by Archie.

The server's reason is this brief's, and the screen is row 2.4's. Apollo's card jAfmblAP carries the cannot-give list with its four reasons, sign-in identity among them, on the delegation screen. This brief asserts that the server returns the reason 'sign-in identity' for such an entry, and names jAfmblAP as where a person sees it. No screen work is duplicated here. Answered by Archie.

Correction of the lead, Archie, given on 28 September 2026 after reading the brief written by run 9c512bc3 at d8beac4a, which is not signed off. The brief id DIRECTORY-009 and the checklist ids C31 to C36 and story ids S13 to S17 it took are held with other text on brief/directory/lifecycle-hand, on its card-gate branches, and on six open directory drafts, so the brief, its checklist items and its stories take the next free ids past main and every open brief, draft, card and hand branch, read with git ls-remote and git show immediately before writing, and every cross-reference follows. The words' first sentences are carried as written: a sign-in identity is a person's link to a provider, such as a Google or GitHub account, through which that person signs in, and the sentence naming DIRECTORY-004 and DIRECTORY-006 stays whole. The ruling sentence that the brief does not pretend the token is something other than what it is stays as a sentence, and the sentence naming Apollo's card jAfmblAP with its four reasons stays as written. Each blocked_by entry states one command a stranger runs against lys main with its expected output, including the DIRECTORY-003 manifest entry and the DIRECTORY-004 fork-side check. The verification line runs cargo fmt, never a fmt check, and states the exit code expected of each command. Nothing else in the brief changes. Answered by Archie, lead for the identity line.
- Cluster: directory; briefs: DIRECTORY-038
- Notes: Ids under the correction of 28 September: the next free past main and every open brief, draft, card and hand branch, read with git ls-remote and git show immediately before writing (339 refs listed and every one's objects read, first by the run that wrote the draft and again before this amendment, where only this draft's own branch holds DIRECTORY-038, RM-065, C313 to C318, S136 to S140 and ADR-105). The highest seen were DIRECTORY-037, C312, S135, RM-064 and ADR-104, all on draft/directory/3e63b2d8, so this row is RM-065, the brief DIRECTORY-038, its checklist items C313 to C318, its stories S136 to S140 and its decision ADR-105; DIRECTORY-009, C31 to C36 and S13 to S17 are not used. DIRECTORY-006, which DIRECTORY-038 also waits on, has no roadmap row on main. Findings recorded in DIRECTORY-038's task: against SECRETS-002, the broker refuses to issue an agent any credential derived from a person's sign-in session (row 1.2 is met in full only when that line passes); against DIRECTORY-004, its link path consults the directory's bindings before the fork links. Further units, not written: SECRETS-002: the broker refuses to issue an agent any credential derived from a person's sign-in session; jAfmblAP: the cannot-give list shows sign-in identities with the reason 'sign-in identity' on the delegation screen; CONFORMANCE.md row 1.2: point its Brief column at the new directory brief; Fork-side refusal of a person linking a provider account already bound to an agent.

## The design

---
type: design
cluster: directory
title: The standalone identity directory, with every grant rooted in a person
---

# The standalone identity directory, with every grant rooted in a person

> **Cluster:** directory

## Intention

An operator installs the identity product without Cambium or Manifold, signs in, links Google and GitHub to one person, registers an agent under a responsible person, and inspects the signed history of every identity change. Cambium later uses this issuer, keeping its participant ids (rows 06 and 07); that direction is recorded here while rows 06 and 07 stay the non-goal recorded below, and this sentence promises neither row.

## Problem

IDENTITY-001 revision 5 is the reviewed plan for this, in the older row form, and it predates Tom's ruling of 22 September 17:15 that every grant is pegged to a human authority, his PostgreSQL ruling of 23 September 14:14, and the working lifecycle states. Its row 02 installs SpiceDB without saying what it enforces. It cannot be dispatched to the design-system loop as it stands.

## Solution

Carry IDENTITY-001's open rows (02, 04, 03, 05) into design-system briefs in this cluster, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, revised for the grant ruling (ADR-003), the PostgreSQL ruling (ADR-005) and the working lifecycle states (ADR-011, proposed), with the fork (ADR-009) and the product accents (ADR-010) in the project ledger and every decision still open for Tom marked open. The IDENTITY-001 files stay as they are, as the record of revision 5.

DIRECTORY-038 carries conformance row 1.2: sign-in identities belong to people only (ADR-105). A sign-in identity is a provider account (P1) linked to a person in the directory; the directory classifies every issuer-subject pair from its signed history as a sign-in identity, an agent's own account, unbound, or unreconciled while its link is not yet reconciled (P5). The refusals sit in seams other rows already own: the DIRECTORY-003 R1 binding API, the directory's side of the link path beside the DIRECTORY-003 R4 receiver (an issuer and subject is bound to one holder, whichever came first; a person's refused link is recorded in the history, naming the agent to its responsible person and a directory administrator and never to the person linking), and DIRECTORY-006 admission and explanation. One refusal value carries two views: the identity's owner and a directory administrator see the provider and subject, everyone else only that a sign-in identity is involved. The broker's refusal is a finding against SECRETS-002, and the harness login token (SECRETS-002 R5) is the one named exception, never passing through anything lys issues, links or delegates.

## Principles

- **P1** — An enduring identity ID is stable through provider additions, key rotation and later sessions; issuer plus subject identifies an external login; email and display name never establish identity equivalence.
- **P2** — Everything is pegged to a human authority: the responsible person's permissions are the ceiling and an agent holds an explicit subset; exercising an act and delegating it are separate grants; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it.
- **P3** — A person or agent may be registered before any session exists; registration creates no running state and issues no Rauthy login, runtime credential or capability certificate.
- **P4** — One signed committed directory event is both the identity change and its audit record; never a database change followed by a best-effort log append.
- **P5** — No success before durable evidence; an uncertain append is reconciled before its projection answers as current, and pending or refused outcomes stay visible until resolved.
- **P6** — A future execution or fork ID refers to its enduring identity and, for a fork, its parent execution; step 1 reserves that distinction in the contract and implements neither session history nor launch.
- **P7** — An audit receipt carries a version, a stable operation ID, the actor, the affected identity, the operation, a payload commitment and the resulting log coordinate or checkpoint; secrets and whole context objects are excluded, and its exact signed encoding is reviewed before use.
- **P8** — The service attests the authenticated human actor and their authentication provenance; it never claims a person signed bytes with a key they do not hold, and a registration records the person who made it, never an invented agent signature.
- **P9** — The initial directory administrator is bootstrapped by an explicitly configured issuer and subject, never by email or first visitor; every other mutation caller is refused in step 1.

## Decisions

- ADR-001 — Secrets are held behind a handle the door swaps for the credential — A seat holds a short-lived handle bound to its identity. The real credential sits in the door's encrypted store and never leaves the server. The door's proxy checks SpiceDB, swaps the handle for the credential, forwards the call and writes one audit line. Built in Rust inside the door; no OpenBao unless credentials minted on demand are later needed.
- ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
- ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
- ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL, possibly on a network device — PostgreSQL is used for the identity product's database. It may be set up on one of the network devices rather than on Tom's Mac.
- ADR-007 — The product starts an agent by giving its start command, never by running it — The product is not an execution engine. For the first release an agent's file gives the command that starts it on a chosen machine: the command carries the agent's identity and its handles, never a credential's value, and it is rendered from the agent's kept launch record. A started agent reports back, so the sessions screen shows what is running. A terminal inside the product, sandboxes, virtual machines and containers are later runtimes that plug in, and none is built into this product.
- ADR-008 — An agent's file shows its lys certificate — An agent's file shows its lys certificate once one is issued: what it claims, who signed it, when it was issued and when it expires, with the signed receipts of the changes made to it. An agent registered before any key or proof of possession was supplied shows its certificate as not issued, never a placeholder.
- ADR-009 — People sign in through a maintained Rauthy fork of our own — Rauthy authenticates people, and its one-provider-per-user limit is changed in a fork we maintain, ablative-io/rauthy, not contributed upstream as a prerequisite. The maintained branch is ablative, created from upstream v0.36.2 commit dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; the fork's main stays an untouched upstream mirror; lys pins an exact commit of ablative as the submodule vendor/rauthy. Upgrades rebase ablative onto upstream release tags only, each in its own gated row; no cherry-picks and no reset of main.
- ADR-010 — Every product shares one design and keeps its own accent; the identity product's is orange — The identity screens follow Aion's structure, typography, spacing and interaction, and Rauthy's client themes take the same colours, with no build dependency on Cambium or Aion. Each product keeps its own accent within the estate colour family: Cambium green, Aion blue and black, Argus light blue, Haematite mustard. The identity product's accent is orange (accent #D4975A, deep #A86B2E, wash #3D2A17 in the estate colour tokens), set apart from Manifold's copper. No product is silently made Aion-blue, and purple is not used.
- ADR-011 — An identity is registered, active, suspended or retired — An identity is in one of four states: registered (exists in the directory, no grants, no credential handle, may not act), active (may act within its grants), suspended (kept whole, grants kept but not effective) and retired (permanent, history kept, never reactivated; a new identity is made instead). Register, activate, suspend, reinstate and retire are the only transitions, each one signed audit record naming the authenticated actor and their provenance, the identity, from, to, when and reason. Having a grant or a credential is a fact beside the state, not a state. A person is registered by first sign-in; an agent is registered by a signed-in person, who carries it as its responsible person for life and may cause every transition of their own agents. Source: docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:17-44 and docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:71-95.
- ADR-105 — Sign-in identities belong to people only; the harness login token is the one named exception — A sign-in identity, a provider account linked to a person in the directory, belongs to that person only: lys never links, delegates or issues from it to an agent, and refuses each such act of its own by name. An agent's own machine account, bound to no person, is a service account and stays allowed. An issuer and subject is bound to one holder, whichever came first. The harness login token recorded at docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:43 and :167 and docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md:18 is the one named exception; it never passes through anything lys issues, links or delegates, and it is not redefined. Rejected: letting a person lend a sign-in identity to their own agent, and redefining the login token so the rule could be claimed without an exception.

## Goals

- Every open row of IDENTITY-001 (02, 04, 03, 05) exists as a valid design-system brief in this cluster, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in its dependency order, every ID001 acceptance identifier kept.
- The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement of the row that owns it, with acceptance criteria; where the sources do not settle the row, it is recorded open for Tom in DIRECTORY-003 with its criteria drafted.
- Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open and decided nowhere in this cluster.
- The two live demonstrations to Tom, ID001_LINK_LIVE and ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE, stay hold points a loop completion never replaces (CN6).
- DIRECTORY-006 makes the grant/refusal journey enforceable and binds its acceptance to the reviewed mock-up, without rewriting the historical IDENTITY-001 record.
- DIRECTORY-038 states and tests conformance row 1.2: linking a person's provider account to an agent, and delegating from a sign-in identity, are each refused by name and write nothing; one counted test over the store finds no agent record carrying a sign-in identity; the broker's refusal is recorded as a finding against SECRETS-002, on which row 1.2's full pass waits.

## Non-Goals

- Rows 06 (connect Cambium) and 07 (gate, install and demonstrate the release) — They change the Cambium repository and depend on IDENTITY-002, the upstream release rebase; they need a Cambium cluster or an agreed cross-repository arrangement first.
- Row 03's changes inside the Rauthy fork — The fork is its own repository under vendor/rauthy; a row whose files live there needs its own brief in the fork, which does not yet exist and blocks DIRECTORY-004. DIRECTORY-004 names the fork files as work with their owner, not as files of this repository.
- The grant representation: how one grant records who may exercise it, whether it may be passed on (person, agent or nobody), what it derives from, and whether it can be bounded. OPEN for Tom. — The statement leaves the exact delegation schema unsettled (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:21; ADR-003); AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23's questions (docs/design/identity/AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md:17-23) are inputs to it, not answers.
- Suspension semantics: whether suspending a person also ends their sign-in session at Rauthy or only makes our checks refuse, and what else stops with a suspended identity. OPEN for Tom. — The lifecycle document asks it of the room (docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:99-100, docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:104-105) and its states are only proposed (ADR-011); two systems, one decision.
- The name of the identity service. OPEN for Tom. — The statement lists it as not decided (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:192); no crate or directory name selects it.
- Which anchor the first agents pin to: our hosted anchor, a self-hosted one, or both. OPEN for Tom. — Lys leaves it as a product decision and so does the statement (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:193).
- A nightly Rauthy base versus waiting for an upstream release carrying #1696 and #1728. OPEN for Tom. — Waffles' ruling of 15:36:25: if upstream has published no such release by the row 05 showing, Tom decides (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:18; docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:177); rows 02 to 05 run on v0.36.2 meanwhile.
- Road step 2 onward: capability certificates, arbitrary grants and their enforcement, session launch and stop, credential handles, memory, context assembly, lanterns and anchoring in production — Revision 5 keeps them out of step 1 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:29-30); ADR-007 (the start command) and ADR-008 (the certificate on an agent's file) govern what the step-1 screens do not present as working.
- The examples in AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23 (abilities with an assignment or project, seat provisioning within a budget, private and shared notes) — Tom gave them as not yet decided (docs/design/identity/AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md:11-15); they are never turned into requirements.
- A production Cambium auth cutover, and any upstream Rauthy contribution as a prerequisite — Revision 5 forbids both before scratch acceptance, review and Gypsy's coordinated install (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:31).
- A shared design-system package extracted for every product — Tom left it as a thing to look at, not a row (ADR-010).
- The broker's refusal to issue an agent any credential derived from a person's sign-in session — Issuance is the broker's (ADR-001); DIRECTORY-038 records it as a finding against SECRETS-002, carried by the broker's card.
- The cannot-give list on the delegation screen — The screen is row 2.4's, carried by Cambium card jAfmblAP; DIRECTORY-038 supplies only the server's reason 'sign-in identity'.

## Inventory

- `docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json` — IDENTITY-001 revision 5, the reviewed plan these briefs carry forward: rows, walls, acceptance identifiers (ID001_*), estimates, authority and review decisions. Read, never changed.
- `docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.md` — its rendered twin
- `docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md` — the authority, including 'Everything is pegged to a human authority (Tom, 17:15 to 17:16)'
- `docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md` — the working lifecycle states: registered, active, suspended, retired
- `docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md` — provisioning an agent under a human, the seven-step path
- `docs/design/identity/AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md` — Tom's 23 September ruling: 'If a human can do it through the UI, then I want an agent to be able to do it'; whether an agent may is a permission question. Input to the directory and permission rows. Its examples are recorded as undecided and are never turned into requirements.
- `docs/design/identity/RAUTHY-BASELINE.md` — the fork baseline: pin, maintenance owner, the IDENTITY-001-UPSTREAM-AUTH-STATE blocker; read, never changed
- `docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md` — Accepted mock-up behaviour map; DIRECTORY-006 maps You/delegation/access requirements and does not claim mock-up sample policy is authoritative.
- `vendor/rauthy` — the maintained Rauthy fork (ADR-009), the git submodule pinned at dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662, the upstream v0.36.2 commit the ablative branch was created from; DIRECTORY-004 moves the pin (structure row); read here, never changed by a document row
- `crates/lys` — the lys CLI crate: Cargo.toml, src/main.rs, src/cli.rs and src/commands/ (attest, ca, key, log, inspect, files); DIRECTORY-002 adds src/identity/ and the identity subcommand to it (structure rows)
- `docs/design/decisions.json` — the project decision ledger, ADR-001 to ADR-018 at main, holding the decisions this cluster cites (ADR-003, ADR-004, ADR-005, ADR-007 to ADR-011); DIRECTORY-001 recorded that it gained the identity decisions (structure row); read here, never changed by a document row
- `docs/design/secrets/briefs/SECRETS-002.json` — the broker brief: R4 keeps a sign-in identity and an OAuth service-access grant as distinct records, R5 puts the seat's login token into its environment at spawn; DIRECTORY-038 records a finding against it and changes nothing in it

## Constraints

- **CN1** — Documents only: nothing outside docs/design/directory/ and docs/design/decisions.json is created or modified; the IDENTITY-001 files are not changed.
- **CN2** — Development isolation: rows 02 to 05 use only disposable test identities and test provider registrations; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration.
- **CN3** — Every path written in a document of this cluster is relative to the repository root, whatever directory a session starts in; a command runs from its own tree and spells its paths from there.
- **CN4** — No structure row or files entry carries a root token; a file in another repository is named in a requirement's spec with its owner.
- **CN5** — A live demonstration to Tom is never an acceptance criterion of a loop requirement; it is a verification step a person performs after the row lands.
- **CN6** — The live demonstrations ID001_LINK_LIVE (after row 03) and ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE (after row 05) are mandatory operator hold points: the brief that follows each is blocked by it until Tom's demonstration receipt is recorded; a loop completion never stands in for one.
- **CN7** — Revision 5's ceiling stands: 48 focused implementer hours for IDENTITY-001 (row 01 1.5, closed; 02 8; 04 10; 03 10; 05 6; 06 4; 07 5; total 44.5, contingency 3.5), with IDENTITY-002's 4 hours outside it. An overrun is reported as soon as it is known, and Waffles takes any ceiling change to Tom (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:24).
- **CN8** — One implementer, one row in implementation and one gate invocation at a time in this lane; release builds, checks and tests run through the gate workflow at the venue, and a development exception never bypasses it (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:25-27, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:135).
- **CN9** — A row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and the reviewer approves a brief revision before that file is edited; a directory wall for a wholly new module allows only its named responsibility and needs an exact file manifest reviewed before its row starts (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:28).
- **CN10** — Rows 02 to 05 run on Rauthy v0.36.2 under Waffles' ruling of 15:36:25; each development install checks current releases and advisories and records the accepted exception; IDENTITY-001-UPSTREAM-AUTH-STATE binds real sign-in and install, rows 06 and 07 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:18, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:46).
- **CN11** — Step 1 is directory records, sign-in and the minimum signed identity audit. SpiceDB is installed and checked in row 02 and enforces nothing in step 1; live capability policy and its enforcement are step 2's, and running SpiceDB is not permission enforcement (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:29-30).
- **CN12** — DIRECTORY-006 is implementation work after the frozen planning task: its source paths are only executable after the DIRECTORY-002/003 foundations are implemented and their integration manifests are reconciled. R6 also waits for the standalone surface foundation. Do not dispatch from a schema-valid but dependency-blocked brief.

# DIRECTORY-001: Revise the identity directory plan for human-rooted grants, as design-system briefs

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
> - ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
> - ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL, possibly on a network device — PostgreSQL is used for the identity product's database. It may be set up on one of the network devices rather than on Tom's Mac.
> **Checklist:**
> - C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
> - C2 — The project decision ledger holds the identity decisions with their authority and quote: the maintained Rauthy fork, one PostgreSQL service and database (ADR-005, already recorded), the product accents, and the lifecycle states as working team decisions marked proposed.
> - C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task.
> - C4 — The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement with acceptance criteria in the row that owns it, and row 02 states what SpiceDB enforces in step 1 and what it does not.
> - C5 — Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open: the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor, and nightly versus waiting for the upstream release.
> - C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.
> **Stories:**
> - S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.
> - S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

## Purpose

Rewrite the identity plan so every grant traces back to a person (Tom, 22 September 17:15), with the PostgreSQL decision and the four lifecycle states in, as design-system briefs the loop can build. Documents only; comes before any code.

## Task

Read IDENTITY-001.json revision 5 in full, the statement's section 'Everything is pegged to a human authority', LIFECYCLE-STATES, PROVISIONING, AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23 (its examples are undecided and are not requirements), and ADR-005 in docs/design/decisions.json, which already records Tom's PostgreSQL ruling. Add the identity decisions to docs/design/decisions.json, complete this cluster's design, checklist and stories, and write DIRECTORY-002 (row 02, 8 hours), DIRECTORY-003 (row 04, 10 hours), DIRECTORY-004 (row 03, 10 hours) and DIRECTORY-005 (row 05, 6 hours), each depending on the one before, revision 5's 48-hour ceiling kept and any re-estimate stated. Carry every ID001 acceptance identifier forward unchanged. Every path in a document of this cluster is relative to the repository root, even though the session starts in docs/.

## Requirements

### R1: Record the identity decisions and complete the directory design

THE SYSTEM SHALL add to docs/design/decisions.json one ADR per identity decision named in C2 that the ledger does not already hold (ADR-005, PostgreSQL, is already there and is cited, not rewritten), each with its authority, date, decider and, where the source holds Tom's own words, the quote; a working team decision SHALL be status proposed, never decided. The directory design SHALL gain those ADR ids and SHALL keep revision 5's outcome, shared contract, constraints and non-goals, revised for the grant ruling. Each ADR's source SHALL be cited from IDENTITY-001's authority or review_decisions, the statement, or the lifecycle document; nothing is invented.

**Acceptance:**
- validate.py reports decisions.json and design.json valid.
- Every ADR added cites its source, and the lifecycle states ADR is status proposed.
- ADR-005 is unchanged and the directory design anchors to it.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/decisions.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/design.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md

**Checklist:**
- C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
- C2 — The project decision ledger holds the identity decisions with their authority and quote: the maintained Rauthy fork, one PostgreSQL service and database (ADR-005, already recorded), the product accents, and the lifecycle states as working team decisions marked proposed.

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.

#### R1 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Row 1 (validate.py reports decisions.json and design.json valid): both files were written to the decisions and design schemas. I checked keys and types against docs/design/decisions.json:146-199 and docs/design/directory/design.json with my own code, not validate.py, which the workflow runs. Row 2 (every added ADR cites its source; the lifecycle ADR is proposed): ADR-009 at docs/design/decisions.json:146 cites the statement at :191 and IDENTITY-001 at :10, :17 and :35. ADR-010 at :164 cites the statement at :194 and IDENTITY-001 at :14-15 and :43-44. ADR-011 at :182 cites LIFECYCLE-STATES at :17-44 and :71-95 and has "status": "proposed" (:184). Row 3 (ADR-005 unchanged, design anchors to it): a comparison against HEAD shows the ADR-001 to ADR-008 prefix is identical. ADR-005 stays in docs/design/directory/design.json 'decisions' (:45). Revision 5's content is kept, revised for the grant ruling: the outcome is the intention, the shared contract is P1 to P9 (:7-44), the constraints are CN1 to CN11 (:444) and the non-goals start at :61.
- Deviation: (none)
- Files changed:
  - modified: `docs/design/decisions.json` — 'updated' is now 2026-09-24. Three ADRs added: ADR-009 (the maintained Rauthy fork, decided, Tom with Waffles' branch rule, with Tom's quote), ADR-010 (shared design with each product keeping its own accent, identity orange, decided, Tom's 15:18 quote) and ADR-011 (registered/active/suspended/retired, status proposed, Archie for the working team). Each cites its sources; ADR-001 to ADR-008 are byte-identical.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/design.json` — Adds principles P6 to P9 from revision 5's shared contract and review decisions, with P3 revised. Decisions now ADR-003, 004, 005, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011. Goals, non-goals (five marked OPEN for Tom), constraints CN7 to CN11 from revision 5's ceiling, a structure row for every listed path, and the RAUTHY-BASELINE inventory entry.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md` — Markdown rendered from design.json with the method's render_design.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling. — Outcome, principles P1 to P9, CN7 to CN11 and the revised non-goals are in docs/design/directory/design.json.
  - [x] C2 — The project decision ledger holds the identity decisions with their authority and quote: the maintained Rauthy fork, one PostgreSQL service and database (ADR-005, already recorded), the product accents, and the lifecycle states as working team decisions marked proposed. — Fork (ADR-009), PostgreSQL (ADR-005, cited), accents (ADR-010) and lifecycle states (ADR-011, proposed).
- Story delivery:
  - [x] S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it. — P2 and ADR-003 anchor the design. Every agent is registered under its responsible person (DIRECTORY-003 R1).

**Review (recorded):**

- Alignment: aligned
- Acceptance verdicts:
  - [x] validate.py reports decisions.json and design.json valid. — From docs/: validate.py docs/design/decisions.json -> 'design/decisions.json: OK [decisions.schema.json] All 1 document(s) valid.' (exit 0); validate.py docs/design/directory -> 'design/directory/design.json: OK [design.schema.json]', all 8 valid (exit 0).
  - [x] Every ADR added cites its source, and the lifecycle states ADR is status proposed. — docs/design/decisions.json ADR-009 context cites STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:191 and IDENTITY-001.json:10, :17, :35, all verified; the quote matches STATEMENT:191 verbatim. ADR-010 cites STATEMENT:194 and IDENTITY-001.json:14-15, :43-44; its hex values match IDENTITY-001.json:44; its quote matches STATEMENT:194 verbatim. ADR-011 cites LIFECYCLE-STATES:1-8, :17-44, :71-95, :101-103, with status 'proposed' and decided_by 'Archie ... not ruled by Tom'.
  - [x] ADR-005 is unchanged and the directory design anchors to it. — A Python comparison of HEAD:docs/design/decisions.json decisions[] against the working tree's first 8 entries -> 'prefix same True'. design.json decisions list contains ADR-005 (DESIGN.md Decisions section).
- Checklist verified: C1, C2
- Stories verified: S1

### R2: Carry rows 02, 04, 03 and 05 into design-system briefs

THE SYSTEM SHALL write DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005 from revision 5's rows 02, 04, 03 and 05, each valid against the brief schema: its work as requirements, its wall as files (a file in the Rauthy fork, which is its own repository under vendor/rauthy, is named in the spec with its owner and is not listed in files), its acceptance as criteria keeping every ID001 identifier, its dependencies as depends_on, its estimate in its task. A live demonstration to Tom SHALL be a verification step, never an acceptance criterion. Every path a row brief lists SHALL gain a structure row in design.json. DIRECTORY-004 (row 03) SHALL carry in blocked_by the fork-owned brief that does not yet exist, named as such, so it is never an executable brief with an empty wall. DIRECTORY-005 SHALL carry in blocked_by the ID001_LINK_LIVE demonstration to Tom, and the design's hold point for ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE SHALL be kept, per CN6.

**Acceptance:**
- DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005 exist and validate.py reports each valid.
- Each ID001 acceptance identifier of rows 02, 04, 03 and 05 appears in its brief.
- depends_on runs DIRECTORY-002, then 003, then 004, then 005, matching revision 5's order 02, 04, 03, 05.
- No acceptance criterion requires a live demonstration; each row's demonstration appears under verification.
- check-coverage.py reports every listed path present in the structure.
- DIRECTORY-004's blocked_by names the missing fork-owned brief.
- DIRECTORY-005's blocked_by names the ID001_LINK_LIVE demonstration.

**Files:**
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.md
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.md
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-004.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-004.md
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json
- create: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md
- modify: docs/design/directory/design.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md

**Checklist:**
- C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

#### R2 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Row 1 (the four briefs exist and are valid): all four follow brief.schema.json's required keys, and my own key check passed. Row 2 (every ID001 identifier kept): a script compared revision 5's acceptance for each row with the briefs and found nothing missing. Row 02 has DEPLOY, DEPLOY_REFUSAL, THEME, SHARED_DB and PIN_CLONE. Row 04 has DIRECTORY, AUDIT_FAULTS, ADMIN, RECEIPT and RECEIVER. Row 03 has LINK_PAIR, LINK_REFUSAL, LINK_MIGRATION, LINK_AUDIT and LINK_LIVE. Row 05 has STANDALONE, SCREEN_REFUSAL and DIRECTORY_LIVE. Row 3 (dependency order): depends_on at line 5 of each brief is DIRECTORY-001 for 002, then 002, 003 and 004 in turn. Row 4 (no live demonstration in acceptance): no acceptance string names a demonstration. ID001_LINK_LIVE and ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE are the last verification entries of DIRECTORY-004 and DIRECTORY-005. Row 5 (every listed path in the structure): I checked each path, directory prefixes included, against docs/design/directory/design.json:107 onward, with none missing. Row 6: DIRECTORY-004.json:8 blocked_by names 'The fork-owned brief for row 03's Rauthy changes, which does not yet exist'. Row 7: DIRECTORY-005.json:8 blocked_by starts with 'ID001_LINK_LIVE: Tom's live demonstration of row 03'. The ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE hold point is kept in CN6 (design.json:466), a design goal, and DIRECTORY-005's verification. Estimates are 8, 10, 10 and 6 hours with no re-estimate, stated in each task, and CN7 keeps the 48-hour ceiling.
- Deviation: Four judgement calls. (1) DIRECTORY-002 depends_on DIRECTORY-001, because row 01 is IDENTITY-001's and is already accepted; that acceptance is stated in the task. (2) Revision 5's report names under docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-*.md are kept as each row's wall, so they carry forward unchanged. (3) DIRECTORY-003 and DIRECTORY-005 carry in blocked_by the exact file manifest that revision 5 (IDENTITY-001.json:28) requires before a wholly new module's row starts. (4) Revision 5's 'edit main in the main Mac checkout, no worktree' venue rule is not carried as a constraint, because this loop now runs in clones. CN8 keeps the part that still binds: one implementer, one row and one gate at a time, with the gate workflow never bypassed.

**Review (recorded):**

- Alignment: fixed
- Acceptance verdicts:
  - [x] DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005 exist and validate.py reports each valid. — validate.py docs/design/directory: DIRECTORY-002.json to DIRECTORY-005.json each 'OK [brief.schema.json]', exit 0 (re-run after the harden edit).
  - [x] Each ID001 acceptance identifier of rows 02, 04, 03 and 05 appears in its brief. — Running grep -o 'ID001_[A-Z_]*' on each brief gives 002: DEPLOY, DEPLOY_REFUSAL, PIN_CLONE, SHARED_DB, THEME; 003: ADMIN, AUDIT_FAULTS, DIRECTORY, RECEIPT, RECEIVER; 004: LINK_PAIR, LINK_REFUSAL, LINK_MIGRATION, LINK_AUDIT, LINK_LIVE; 005: STANDALONE, SCREEN_REFUSAL, DIRECTORY_LIVE.

- Checklist verified: C3
- Stories verified: S2
- Issues:
  - DIRECTORY-003 R1 spec contradicted itself. It said 'a person is registered by first sign-in' and also 'in step 1 the only caller that may register is the configured administrator'. Under P9 and IDENTITY-001.json:38 every non-admin mutation is refused in step 1, so the first clause would lead an implementer to break ID001_ADMIN.
- Fixes:
  - docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json R1 spec: self-registration by first sign-in is now attributed to ADR-011's proposal. The spec states that in step 1 the only caller that may register a person or an agent is the configured administrator (P9, IDENTITY-001.json:38), and that a first sign-in registers nobody. DIRECTORY-003.md was re-rendered with render-cluster.py.

### R3: Put the grant path and the enforcement boundary in the row that owns them

THE SYSTEM SHALL make the grant path named in C4 a requirement, with acceptance criteria, in the row brief the sources place it in, and SHALL state in DIRECTORY-002 what SpiceDB enforces in step 1 and what it does not. Where the sources do not settle which row owns the grant path, the brief SHALL record that as open for Tom and SHALL NOT pick one.

**Acceptance:**
- The grant path appears as one requirement with criteria for allowed-before-revoke and refused-after-revoke, or is recorded as open with the question stated.
- DIRECTORY-002 states SpiceDB's step-1 role in one sentence.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json

**Checklist:**
- C4 — The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement with acceptance criteria in the row that owns it, and row 02 states what SpiceDB enforces in step 1 and what it does not.

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.

#### R3 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Row 1 (grant path as a requirement, or open with the question stated): the sources conflict. Revision 5 keeps arbitrary grants and enforcement in step 2 (IDENTITY-001.json:29-30). Chippy's 17:08 first screen (STATEMENT:183) and PROVISIONING:23-24 put the path in 'steps 1 and 2' without naming a row. So DIRECTORY-003.json:138 (R5 spec) records it as OPEN for Tom and does not pick one, as the spec requires. It asks whether the path lands in DIRECTORY-003, a new row before DIRECTORY-005, or step 2's first brief. It drafts allowed-before-revoke (a), refused-after-revoke (b), refused-after-suspend (c) and audit (d), so nothing is lost. An R5 acceptance criterion requires it to still be open at review. Row 2 (DIRECTORY-002 states SpiceDB's step-1 role in one sentence): DIRECTORY-002.json:139 opens with that sentence: installed, migrated, backed up and health-checked, enforcing nothing, with no decision asked and no grant written, and enforcement left to step 2. It then states what SpiceDB does not do. R4's acceptance requires the sentence verbatim in deploy/identity/README.md.
- Deviation: (none)
- Files changed:
  - created: `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-002.json` — R4 states SpiceDB's step-1 role in one sentence and forbids any check or grant write.
  - created: `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-003.json` — R5 records the grant path's owning row as OPEN for Tom. It states the question and drafts criteria (a) to (d) for whichever row Tom places it in.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C4 — The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement with acceptance criteria in the row that owns it, and row 02 states what SpiceDB enforces in step 1 and what it does not. — Uses the brief's allowed alternative: the grant path's row is recorded open with the question and criteria stated, and row 02 states SpiceDB's step-1 role.
- Story delivery:
  - [x] S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it. — The responsible person is recorded on every agent, and the grant path's criteria are drafted for the row Tom chooses.

**Review (recorded):**

- Alignment: aligned
- Acceptance verdicts:
  - [x] The grant path appears as one requirement with criteria for allowed-before-revoke and refused-after-revoke, or is recorded as open with the question stated. — DIRECTORY-003.json R5 spec records 'OPEN for Tom, not decided here: which row owns the grant path'. It states the question (DIRECTORY-003, a new row before DIRECTORY-005, or step 2's first brief) and the conflicting sources: IDENTITY-001.json:29-30 against STATEMENT:183 and PROVISIONING:23-24, which I verified. It drafts criteria (a) allowed before revoke, (b) refused after revoke, (c) refused after suspend and (d) audit.
  - [x] DIRECTORY-002 states SpiceDB's step-1 role in one sentence. — DIRECTORY-002.json R4 spec opens with a single sentence: 'in step 1 SpiceDB is installed, migrated, backed up and health-checked against the shared PostgreSQL database, and it enforces nothing, because no component asks it for a permission decision or writes a grant to it, and live capability policy and its enforcement stay with road step 2'. Its acceptance requires that sentence word for word in deploy/identity/README.md.

### R4: Mark the open decisions open and keep the cluster covered

THE SYSTEM SHALL record each open decision named in C5 in the design's non-goals or the owning brief as open for Tom, deciding none of them, and SHALL add the rows' checklist items and stories so that every one is named by a row brief and the rendered markdown matches the JSON.

**Acceptance:**
- Each open decision in C5 appears once, marked open.
- check-coverage.py exits 0.
- render-cluster.py leaves the rendered markdown unchanged after the commit.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/checklist.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/CHECKLIST.md
- modify: docs/design/directory/stories.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/USER-STORIES.md

**Checklist:**
- C5 — Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open: the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor, and nightly versus waiting for the upstream release.
- C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

#### R4 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Row 1 (each C5 open decision appears once, marked open): docs/design/directory/design.json non_goals (:61) has one entry each, marked 'OPEN for Tom', for the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor, and nightly versus waiting. The rendered DESIGN.md has them at lines 57-61, and the phrase occurs nowhere else in the cluster except DIRECTORY-003's grant-path question, which is not a C5 item. Row 2 (check-coverage.py exits 0): my own check found every C1 to C20 and S1 to S7 named by a brief and each brief-level array equal to the union of its requirements. Every design_anchor exists in decisions.json, every file path is in the structure and there are no cycles. I did not run check-coverage.py. Row 3 (render leaves the markdown unchanged): every .md was produced by the method's own render_design, render_checklist, render_stories and render_brief functions from the final JSON. DIRECTORY-001.md was re-rendered byte-identical, so the render leg should find no change.
- Deviation: To produce the markdown I imported render-cluster.py's and render-brief.py's functions in a Python snippet instead of hand-writing it. I did not invoke the render-cluster.py command itself, which is the gate leg.
- Files changed:
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/checklist.json` — Four row sections with C7 to C20, each named by a row brief. C1 to C6 are unchanged.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/CHECKLIST.md` — Rendered.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/stories.json` — S4 and S5 added under Responsible person, plus two new personas, Operator (S3, S6) and Verifier (S7). S1 and S2 are unchanged.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/USER-STORIES.md` — Rendered.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C5 — Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open: the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor, and nightly versus waiting for the upstream release. — Five non-goals, each marked OPEN for Tom once. None is decided.
  - [x] C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean. — Markdown was rendered by the method's functions from the final JSON, and my own coverage check is clean. The gate legs will confirm this.
- Story delivery:
  - [x] S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria. — Every checklist item and story is named by a row brief for review.

**Review (recorded):**

- Alignment: aligned
- Acceptance verdicts:
  - [x] Each open decision in C5 appears once, marked open. — design.json non_goals lines 71, 75, 79, 83 and 87 carry one 'OPEN for Tom' entry each for the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name, the anchor and nightly versus waiting (DESIGN.md:57-61). A grep across the cluster JSON finds no other open-marked record of them; DIRECTORY-003's OPEN is the grant-path row, which is not a C5 item, and DIRECTORY-001's hits are the dev record.
  - [x] check-coverage.py exits 0. — From docs/: check-coverage.py docs/design/directory -> 20 items, 7 stories, 5 briefs, 'Coverage clean', exit 0. Two legal warnings: S1 and S3 are each claimed by more than one brief.
  - [x] render-cluster.py leaves the rendered markdown unchanged after the commit. — After the harden edit and one render, I took md5 of every .md in docs/design/directory and briefs, ran render-cluster.py docs/design/directory again and re-hashed: no difference ('RENDER-STABLE').
- Checklist verified: C5, C6
- Stories verified: S2

## Boundaries

- Documents only: only docs/design/directory/ and docs/design/decisions.json change; the IDENTITY-001 files, and everything else, stay byte for byte.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided.
- Rows 06 and 07 are not written here.
- No credential, token or key value is written.
- No row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it.

## Verification

- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory exits 0.
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/decisions.json exits 0.
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exits 0.

# DIRECTORY-002: Install the standalone service dependencies on one PostgreSQL database

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-001
> **Blocked by:** Waffles' review of this brief before it is dispatched (DIRECTORY-001 boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it), Waffles' re-check of revision 5's row-02 module manifest, which IDENTITY-001 records as due before row 02 source starts (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:20, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:407), The venue gate path ID001_PIN_CLONE needs, which revision 5 records as resting with Heimdall (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:17, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:407); the row's gate is not submitted until it is confirmed
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
> - ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL, possibly on a network device — PostgreSQL is used for the identity product's database. It may be set up on one of the network devices rather than on Tom's Mac.
> - ADR-009 — People sign in through a maintained Rauthy fork of our own — Rauthy authenticates people, and its one-provider-per-user limit is changed in a fork we maintain, ablative-io/rauthy, not contributed upstream as a prerequisite. The maintained branch is ablative, created from upstream v0.36.2 commit dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; the fork's main stays an untouched upstream mirror; lys pins an exact commit of ablative as the submodule vendor/rauthy. Upgrades rebase ablative onto upstream release tags only, each in its own gated row; no cherry-picks and no reset of main.
> - ADR-010 — Every product shares one design and keeps its own accent; the identity product's is orange — The identity screens follow Aion's structure, typography, spacing and interaction, and Rauthy's client themes take the same colours, with no build dependency on Cambium or Aion. Each product keeps its own accent within the estate colour family: Cambium green, Aion blue and black, Argus light blue, Haematite mustard. The identity product's accent is orange (accent #D4975A, deep #A86B2E, wash #3D2A17 in the estate colour tokens), set apart from Manifold's copper. No product is silently made Aion-blue, and purple is not used.
> **Checklist:**
> - C7 — Rauthy, SpiceDB and one PostgreSQL service and database are packaged and installed for development, with separate roles and schema namespaces, the database address as configuration, and readiness, restart, named refusals, the shared database and restore proved (ID001_DEPLOY, ID001_DEPLOY_REFUSAL, ID001_SHARED_DB, ID001_PIN_CLONE).
> - C8 — lys identity prepare, configure and health exist in the CLI exactly as revision 5's module manifest names them, register the platform and Cambium clients idempotently, and keep every secret out of Git, logs, errors and health output.
> - C9 — Both Rauthy client themes carry Aion's neutral vocabulary with each product's own accent, Cambium green and the identity orange (ID001_THEME).
> - C10 — SpiceDB's step-1 role is written down and held: installed and checked, asked for no decision, holding no grant.
> **Stories:**
> - S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

## Purpose

Row 02 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5: the three dependency processes of the standalone identity product (the maintained Rauthy, ADR-009; SpiceDB; one PostgreSQL service and database, ADR-005) installed for development with durable storage, the lys CLI that prepares, configures and checks them, and both Rauthy client themes (ADR-010). Revised for Tom's PostgreSQL ruling, which lets the database live on a network device so its address is configuration, and for the grant ruling (ADR-003), which makes SpiceDB's step-1 role explicit: installed and checked, enforcing nothing yet.

## Task

Carry IDENTITY-001 revision 5 row 02 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:89-167) into requirements: packaging and the development install (R1), the lys identity CLI (R2), the two client themes (R3) and SpiceDB's step-1 role (R4). Row 01, the fork and its pin, was accepted by Waffles at 15:36:25 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:18); its fresh recursive-clone proof is due at this row's venue gate (ID001_PIN_CLONE). Estimate: 8 focused implementer hours, revision 5's figure for this row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:20); no re-estimate. Revision 5's 48-hour ceiling stands (CN7); an overrun is reported as soon as it is known. Out: the directory itself (DIRECTORY-003), any grant or permission check, and real sign-in (rows 06 and 07). Every path is relative to the repository root; the estate colour tokens live in another repository and are named in R3's spec with their owner.

## Requirements

### R1: Package Rauthy, SpiceDB and one PostgreSQL database, and install them for development

THE SYSTEM SHALL package the maintained Rauthy at the pinned vendor/rauthy commit (ADR-009), SpiceDB, and one PostgreSQL service with one durable database (ADR-005) in deploy/identity/compose.yaml, with pinned supported releases and image digests in deploy/identity/versions.json, separate least-privilege roles and schema namespaces created by deploy/identity/postgres-init.sql through PostgreSQL's own init directory, explicitly configured credentials, and documented local and TLS origins in deploy/identity/config.example.toml (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:136, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:36). The database address SHALL be configuration and SHALL NOT assume Tom's Mac (ADR-005). Both migration runners and their connection search paths SHALL be verified to coexist before one-database readiness is claimed. These are three dependency processes beside the platform door; Cambium, Manifold, Argus and Aion servers are not runtime dependencies (ADR-004). THE SYSTEM SHALL define readiness, migration order, named configuration failures, stop and start, and backup and restore (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:137), documenting in deploy/identity/README.md the cache, key and config files Rauthy's internal Hiqlite cache needs rather than claiming a SQL dump alone backs up the product; no Hiqlite identity datastore is used in the installed configuration (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:36). The development instance is installed on a node the operator names (ADR-005) with test identities only; release builds, checks and tests stay on the gate workflow, and each development install checks upstream releases and advisories and records the accepted v0.36.2 exception (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:135, CN10). Results, digests and the restore outcome go to docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-deployment.md, the report name revision 5 gives this row.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_DEPLOY: from a fresh venue directory, dependencies become ready with no other Ablative service running; restart preserves issuer identity and database contents.
- ID001_DEPLOY_REFUSAL: missing secret, invalid issuer/redirect and unavailable database produce named failures, never a substitute identity or development database.
- Dependency artifact digests, versions, resolved configuration without secrets and backup/restore result are recorded in docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-deployment.md. This row does not claim the product directory exists yet.
- ID001_SHARED_DB: prove Rauthy and SpiceDB both write/reopen against the same PostgreSQL database, migrations do not collide and the service roles cannot read the other schema. Restore the database plus documented key/config/cache dependencies and repeat readiness.
- ID001_PIN_CLONE: the venue fetches the exact pushed Lys ref with recursive submodules and verifies the expected Rauthy commit on ablative without using the Mac reading copy.
- A test configures a database address other than the local host: the resolved configuration names that address, and no default local address is substituted when it is unreachable (ADR-005).

**Files:**

- create: deploy/identity/versions.json
- create: deploy/identity/config.example.toml
- create: deploy/identity/postgres-init.sql

- create: crates/lys/tests/identity_support/fixtures.rs
- create: crates/lys/tests/identity_support/server.rs
- create: crates/lys/tests/identity_support/compose.rs

**Checklist:**
- C7 — Rauthy, SpiceDB and one PostgreSQL service and database are packaged and installed for development, with separate roles and schema namespaces, the database address as configuration, and readiness, restart, named refusals, the shared database and restore proved (ID001_DEPLOY, ID001_DEPLOY_REFUSAL, ID001_SHARED_DB, ID001_PIN_CLONE).

**Stories:**
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

### R2: Prepare, configure and check the deployment from the lys CLI

THE SYSTEM SHALL implement lys identity prepare, configure and health in the existing lys CLI with exactly revision 5's module manifest (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:154-166): mod.rs declarations and re-exports only; cli.rs the identity subcommand arguments; config.rs typed deployment configuration and validation with no secret value in diagnostics; credentials.rs Zeroizing, redacted credential material and its stable reuse; private_files.rs restricted-mode durable file creation and outcome reconciliation; prepare.rs validating inputs and materialising the declared private artifacts; configure.rs idempotent client and theme reconciliation with stable operation identifiers; rauthy.rs typed Rauthy API requests and responses, named status errors and read-back after an uncertain outcome; health.rs named readiness checks for the declared services; error.rs typed errors carrying operation, resource and path, never secret bytes; themes.rs is R3's. configure SHALL register separate platform and Cambium OIDC clients with exact redirect URIs and RS256 where the Cambium verifier requires it, and the platform's own confidential client with S256 as revision 5 proposes (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:138, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:39). Google and GitHub federation credentials belong to Rauthy; Google API consent remains a different client purpose. Generated credentials stay out of Git and logs, and health output excludes secrets. No Python or shell provisioning engine: health.sh and the external tests/identity_deployment are replaced by these subcommands and Rust integration tests (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:19, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:140).

**Acceptance:**
- A redaction test formats every credential and error type under crates/lys/src/identity/ with Debug and Display, and captures the health output of a configured deployment: none contains a byte of a generated secret.
- prepare creates every declared private file with a restricted mode; a test reads each file's mode and counts the files against the declared set.
- configure run twice against the same Rauthy leaves exactly two clients and their themes with unchanged operation identifiers; a transport failure after a request is resolved by read-back and never creates a second client.
- health names each unready service or database: a test makes each one unavailable in turn and counts one named failure per case, equal to the number of declared services.
- Every module of the manifest exists under crates/lys/src/identity/, no other file is added there, and none exceeds 500 lines of code.

- modify: crates/lys/src/main.rs
- modify: crates/lys/src/cli.rs
- modify: crates/lys/src/commands/error.rs

**Checklist:**
- C8 — lys identity prepare, configure and health exist in the CLI exactly as revision 5's module manifest names them, register the platform and Cambium clients idempotently, and keep every secret out of Git, logs, errors and health output.

**Stories:**
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

### R3: Theme both Rauthy clients with Aion's vocabulary and each product's own accent

THE SYSTEM SHALL configure both Rauthy client themes from Aion's pinned neutral, text and radius vocabulary and each client's own product accent (ADR-010): the Cambium client green, the identity client the identity orange. It SHALL map text, text_high, bg, bg_high, action, accent and error into HSL for light and dark, plus button text colour and border radius, in deploy/identity/rauthy-themes.json, recording every source token and colour conversion in deploy/identity/theme-map.md, read and validated by crates/lys/src/identity/themes.rs, and SHALL verify readable contrast (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:139). Fonts and page layout remain Rauthy's; no font or layout patch and no cross-application build dependency enters the fork. The colour values are read from the estate colour tokens, docs/design-system-v2/palette/estate-colour-tokens.json in the ablative docs repository (owner: Waffles, who added the identity entry at ablative-docs 385916e; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:44); that file is another repository's, is read and never changed, and is named here rather than listed in files (CN4). Its purple status token is not copied.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_THEME: inspect both client login pages in light and dark mode; all seven HSL fields, button text and border radius match the declared mapping, persist after restart and retain readable contrast. Record the source-token ref and Rauthy theme export without credentials.
- The Cambium client's accent is Cambium green and the identity client's is the identity orange of the estate tokens; neither is Aion blue, and no purple token appears in deploy/identity/rauthy-themes.json.

**Files:**
- create: deploy/identity/rauthy-themes.json
- create: deploy/identity/theme-map.md
- create: crates/lys/src/identity/themes.rs
- create: crates/lys/tests/identity_theme.rs

**Checklist:**
- C9 — Both Rauthy client themes carry Aion's neutral vocabulary with each product's own accent, Cambium green and the identity orange (ID001_THEME).

**Stories:**
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

### R4: State what SpiceDB enforces in step 1, and hold to it

SpiceDB's step-1 role, in one sentence: in step 1 SpiceDB is installed, migrated, backed up and health-checked against the shared PostgreSQL database, and it enforces nothing, because no component asks it for a permission decision or writes a grant to it, and live capability policy and its enforcement stay with road step 2 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:30; docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:143). What it does not do in step 1: it answers no check for any identity, it holds no grant or relationship of the directory, the lifecycle state recorded by DIRECTORY-003 gates nothing through it, and running it is not permission enforcement. THE SYSTEM SHALL write that sentence into deploy/identity/README.md, and SHALL NOT add to crates/lys/src/identity/ any SpiceDB permission check, relationship write or schema write; health reads SpiceDB's readiness only. Relationships a test writes to prove ID001_SHARED_DB are test fixtures, not grants.

**Acceptance:**
- deploy/identity/README.md carries the step-1 sentence of this requirement word for word.
- A search of crates/lys/src/identity/ finds SpiceDB named only by the health readiness check and its configuration: no permission check, relationship write or schema write call.

**Files:**
- modify: deploy/identity/README.md

**Checklist:**
- C10 — SpiceDB's step-1 role is written down and held: installed and checked, asked for no decision, holding no grant.

**Stories:**
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

## Boundaries

- Only the files listed in this brief's requirements change; a row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and Waffles approves a brief revision before that file is edited (CN9).
- Development isolation: disposable test identities and test provider registrations only; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration (CN2).
- No credential, token or key value is written in code, tests, fixtures, logs or documents; tests use generated values that are never real credentials.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- A live demonstration to Tom is a verification step a person performs after the row lands, never an acceptance criterion and never claimed by a loop completion (CN5, CN6).
- No row is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it.
- lys-core, its cryptographic primitives and its published wire formats are unchanged.
- SpiceDB is asked for no permission decision and holds no grant in this row (R4).
- No Python or shell provisioning engine.

## Verification

- From the repository root: cargo fmt --check; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps, all clean (CLAUDE.md, gates before any commit).
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0.
- From the repository root: rg -n 'ID001_DEPLOY|ID001_DEPLOY_REFUSAL|ID001_THEME|ID001_SHARED_DB|ID001_PIN_CLONE' crates/lys/tests finds each identifier in a test.
- A search of every file this row touches finds no credential, token or key value.

# DIRECTORY-003: Build the directory contract and signed authoritative identity changes

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-002
> **Blocked by:** Waffles' review of this brief before it is dispatched (DIRECTORY-001 boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it), The exact file manifest for crates/lys-identity/, crates/lys-identity-server/ and tests/identity_contract/, reviewed before this row starts; revision 5 requires one for every wholly new module (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:28, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:190) and none is written yet
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
> - ADR-011 — An identity is registered, active, suspended or retired — An identity is in one of four states: registered (exists in the directory, no grants, no credential handle, may not act), active (may act within its grants), suspended (kept whole, grants kept but not effective) and retired (permanent, history kept, never reactivated; a new identity is made instead). Register, activate, suspend, reinstate and retire are the only transitions, each one signed audit record naming the authenticated actor and their provenance, the identity, from, to, when and reason. Having a grant or a credential is a fact beside the state, not a state. A person is registered by first sign-in; an agent is registered by a signed-in person, who carries it as its responsible person for life and may cause every transition of their own agents. Source: docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:17-44 and docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:71-95.
> **Checklist:**
> - C11 — People and agents are registered with enduring identifiers and issuer-subject bindings, each agent under the signed-in person responsible for it, and registration issues no login, credential or certificate (ID001_DIRECTORY).
> - C12 — Every identity change is one signed event through lys-log-store under a jointly reviewed envelope, every answered projection equals replay across the crash boundaries, and a receipt verifies independently (ID001_AUDIT_FAULTS, ID001_RECEIPT).
> - C13 — Only the configured administrator mutates the directory in step 1; unauthenticated, same-email and wrong issuer-subject callers are refused without effect (ID001_ADMIN).
> - C14 — The link-audit receiver is built and proved against fixtures before row 03 needs it (ID001_RECEIVER).
> - C15 — Each identity's lifecycle state is recorded as ADR-011 proposes, every transition one signed event, and the grant path's row is recorded open for Tom with its criteria drafted.
> **Stories:**
> - S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.
> - S4 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want to register an agent under my name before it ever runs, with every change to it signed, so that who created it and who answers for it is never reconstructed after the fact.
> - S7 (Verifier, Checks a recorded identity change without the operator's cooperation) — As a verifier, I want to check a recorded identity change against a checkpoint and key with standard tooling, so that the directory's history does not rest on the operator's word.

## Purpose

Row 04 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5, built before row 03 as Waffles reordered it: the directory of people and agents, where one signed committed event is both the identity change and its audit record, a receipt anyone can verify, the bounded step-1 administrator, and the link-audit receiver row 03 will need. Revised for the grant ruling (ADR-003): every agent is registered under the signed-in person responsible for it; and for the working lifecycle states (ADR-011, proposed): each identity's state is recorded beside it.

## Task

Carry IDENTITY-001 revision 5 row 04 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:168-207) into requirements: registration under a responsible person (R1), signed events and receipts (R2), the administrator (R3), the link-audit receiver (R4) and the lifecycle state, with the grant path's row recorded open for Tom (R5). Estimate: 10 focused implementer hours, revision 5's figure for this row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:206); no re-estimate, because the responsible person and the lifecycle state ride the same signed event envelope and projection as registration. If Tom places the grant path in this row, its hours are estimated then and any ceiling change goes to Tom through Waffles (CN7). The row's crates are wholly new modules: their exact file manifest is reviewed before the row starts (blocked_by, CN9). Every path is relative to the repository root.

## Requirements

### R1: Register people and agents with enduring identifiers, each agent under its responsible person

THE SYSTEM SHALL add the domain crates crates/lys-identity (directory records, typed API, event projection) and crates/lys-identity-server (OIDC session handling, administrator admission), keeping lys-core, its cryptographic primitives and its published formats unchanged, every new module named in the reviewed manifest (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:190). It SHALL define stable person and agent identifiers, external issuer-subject bindings, registration and display-profile changes, explicit provenance and operation-ID retry semantics, written as the contract in docs/design/identity/DIRECTORY-CONTRACT.md (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:191; P1). Revised for the grant ruling (ADR-003; docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:21): an agent is registered by a signed-in person, and its signed registration event records that person as the agent's responsible person for life (docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:77-81). ADR-011 proposes that a person registers themselves by first sign-in; step 1's bounded administrator policy refuses every other mutation caller (P9; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:38), so in step 1 the only caller that may register a person or an agent is the configured administrator (R3), a first sign-in registers nobody, and every agent's responsible person is the administrator who registered it; wider registration arrives with step 2's assignment (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:38). No API of this row changes an agent's responsible person. Registering an agent SHALL NOT pretend it is running, manufacture a human login for it, or issue it a credential, handle or certificate (P3; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:37). The deployment files gain the directory service beside the three dependencies.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_DIRECTORY: register a person and an agent, edit the display profile, list/read both and reopen; enduring IDs and signed history remain unchanged.
- A registered agent's record and its signed registration event both name its responsible person, the signed-in person who registered it; a registration without a signed-in caller is refused and creates no record; no request of the API changes an agent's responsible person.
- Registering an agent creates no Rauthy user and issues no credential, handle or certificate: a test counts Rauthy users and issued credentials before and after a registration and finds both counts unchanged.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/
- create: tests/identity_contract/
- create: docs/design/identity/DIRECTORY-CONTRACT.md
- modify: Cargo.toml
- modify: Cargo.lock
- modify: deploy/identity/compose.yaml
- modify: deploy/identity/config.example.toml
- modify: deploy/identity/README.md

**Checklist:**
- C11 — People and agents are registered with enduring identifiers and issuer-subject bindings, each agent under the signed-in person responsible for it, and registration issues no login, credential or certificate (ID001_DIRECTORY).

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.
- S4 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want to register an agent under my name before it ever runs, with every change to it signed, so that who created it and who answers for it is never reconstructed after the fact.

### R2: Commit every identity change as one signed event through lys-log-store

THE SYSTEM SHALL commit every signed directory change through lys-log-store and rebuild projections from those events at open, reconciling an uncertain write before any affected read answers as current (P4, P5; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:192, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:40). The versioned event envelope, outside lys-core, with typed audit and context payloads, the log coordinate returned in the receipt outside the leaf and service-attested human actions, SHALL be reviewed jointly with Archie before it signs durable bytes, and written in docs/design/identity/IDENTITY-EVENTS.md; the commitment hash is named explicitly, and a SHA-256 attestation commitment is never confused with a BLAKE3 content address (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:45). A receipt carries the fields of P7. THE SYSTEM SHALL provide a read-only receipt and inclusion-verification path (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:193). The service attests the authenticated human actor and their provenance and never claims a person signed bytes with a key they do not hold (P8). The log is lys-log-store's file storage, not a Haematite backend (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:45).

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_AUDIT_FAULTS: enumerate append/pin/projection crash boundaries and count exercised cases; every answered projection equals replay; uncertain operations retain identity and resolve once without silent loss or double application.
- ID001_RECEIPT: independently verify a recorded change against a checkpoint/key; changed actor, payload, sequence or signature fails verification. Secret-redaction tests cover debug, errors and serialized public responses.
- docs/design/identity/IDENTITY-EVENTS.md records the envelope's version, its typed payloads and the named commitment hash, and records Archie's review of it before any durable bytes are signed under it.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/
- create: tests/identity_contract/
- create: docs/design/identity/IDENTITY-EVENTS.md

**Checklist:**
- C12 — Every identity change is one signed event through lys-log-store under a jointly reviewed envelope, every answered projection equals replay across the crash boundaries, and a receipt verifies independently (ID001_AUDIT_FAULTS, ID001_RECEIPT).

**Stories:**
- S4 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want to register an agent under my name before it ever runs, with every change to it signed, so that who created it and who answers for it is never reconstructed after the fact.
- S7 (Verifier, Checks a recorded identity change without the operator's cooperation) — As a verifier, I want to check a recorded identity change against a checkpoint and key with standard tooling, so that the directory's history does not rest on the operator's word.

### R3: Admit only the configured administrator to change the directory

THE SYSTEM SHALL authenticate the initial directory administrator by an explicitly configured issuer and subject, never by email or by being the first visitor, fail closed for every other mutation caller, and make the limited step-1 authority visible (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:193, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:38; P9). General assignment and why-access views arrive in step 2.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_ADMIN: an unauthenticated caller, a non-admin with the same email, and wrong issuer/subject are refused; denied calls cannot mutate state.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/
- create: tests/identity_contract/

**Checklist:**
- C13 — Only the configured administrator mutates the directory in step 1; unauthenticated, same-email and wrong issuer-subject callers are refused without effect (ID001_ADMIN).

**Stories:**
- S4 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want to register an agent under my name before it ever runs, with every change to it signed, so that who created it and who answers for it is never reconstructed after the fact.

### R4: Build the link-audit receiver before row 03 needs it

THE SYSTEM SHALL build and test the authenticated link-audit receiver against the reviewed typed contract and fixtures before DIRECTORY-004 needs it. It consumes the minimal durable source selected in row 01 (a same-transaction link audit record or outbox with stable operation IDs and explicit pending and acknowledged state; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:42), deduplicates stable source operation IDs and returns verifiable receipts. It separates issuer observations from human-signed claims, and audit actor provenance survives replay (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:194).

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_RECEIVER: fixture delivery, duplicate delivery, lost acknowledgement, receiver restart and unauthorized source exercise the reviewed link-audit contract without requiring the future multi-provider fork. Count each leg and prove one logical event per source operation.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/
- create: tests/identity_contract/

**Checklist:**
- C14 — The link-audit receiver is built and proved against fixtures before row 03 needs it (ID001_RECEIVER).

**Stories:**
- S7 (Verifier, Checks a recorded identity change without the operator's cooperation) — As a verifier, I want to check a recorded identity change against a checkpoint and key with standard tooling, so that the directory's history does not rest on the operator's word.

### R5: Record each identity's lifecycle state, and keep the grant path's row open

THE SYSTEM SHALL record beside each identity its lifecycle state as ADR-011 proposes (docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:17-44): registration yields registered; activate, suspend, reinstate and retire are the only transitions, each one signed directory event naming the authenticated actor and their provenance, the identity, from, to, when and the reason given; a retired identity is never reactivated; a transition outside the table is refused by name and records nothing. In step 1 the caller is the configured administrator (R3). The state is recorded, not enforced: nothing in this row reads it to admit or refuse an action (CN11). ADR-011 is status proposed; a change to the states by Tom is a brief revision before this requirement is built.

OPEN for Tom, not decided here: which row owns the grant path. The path: a person signs in, creates an agent under themselves, grants it one project, the agent's action on that project is allowed, the grant is revoked or the agent suspended, and the same action is refused by name, with the audit record naming who made each change (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:183, Chippy 17:08; docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md:39-46). The sources do not settle its row. Revision 5 keeps arbitrary grants and live capability enforcement out of step 1 and in road step 2 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:29-30). Chippy's concrete first screen of 17:08, said after revision 5 was written, puts the path on step 1's screen (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:183), and PROVISIONING places the grant in 'steps 1 and 2 of the road' without naming a row (docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md:23-24). The question for Tom: does the grant path land in this row (DIRECTORY-003), in a new row of this cluster before DIRECTORY-005, or in the first brief of road step 2? Whichever row it lands in carries these criteria, drafted here so none is lost: (a) allowed before revoke: with the agent active and one grant on project P, the agent's action on P is admitted; (b) refused after revoke: once the grant is revoked, the same action is refused by name at the next check and nothing on P changes; (c) refused after suspend: once the agent is suspended, the same action is refused by name while its grant stays recorded, under whatever suspension semantics Tom settles (design non-goals); (d) every grant, revoke and transition is one signed audit record naming the actor. None of (a) to (d) is an acceptance criterion of this brief.

**Acceptance:**
- A test drives register, activate, suspend, reinstate and retire on one agent and counts 5 signed events, each naming actor, identity, from, to and time; the projection after reopen equals replay.
- Each transition outside the table (retired to active, registered to suspended, registered to retired, and a transition of an unknown identity) is refused by name and the log's size does not change; the test counts one refusal per case it names.
- No code in this row asks SpiceDB for a decision or writes a grant to it, and the grant path's row is still recorded open for Tom, with its question and drafted criteria, when the row is reviewed.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/
- create: tests/identity_contract/
- create: docs/design/identity/DIRECTORY-CONTRACT.md

**Checklist:**
- C15 — Each identity's lifecycle state is recorded as ADR-011 proposes, every transition one signed event, and the grant path's row is recorded open for Tom with its criteria drafted.

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.

## Boundaries

- Only the files listed in this brief's requirements change; a row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and Waffles approves a brief revision before that file is edited (CN9).
- Development isolation: disposable test identities and test provider registrations only; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration (CN2).
- No credential, token or key value is written in code, tests, fixtures, logs or documents; tests use generated values that are never real credentials.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- A live demonstration to Tom is a verification step a person performs after the row lands, never an acceptance criterion and never claimed by a loop completion (CN5, CN6).
- No row is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it.
- lys-core, its cryptographic primitives and its published wire formats are unchanged; the event envelope lives outside lys-core and signs no durable bytes before its joint review with Archie.
- No grant is written and no permission is enforced in this row; the grant path's row stays open for Tom (R5).
- Registration issues no login, credential, handle or certificate.

## Verification

- From the repository root: cargo fmt --check; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps, all clean (CLAUDE.md, gates before any commit).
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0.
- From the repository root: rg -n 'ID001_DIRECTORY|ID001_AUDIT_FAULTS|ID001_ADMIN|ID001_RECEIPT|ID001_RECEIVER' crates/lys-identity tests/identity_contract finds each identifier in a test.
- A search of every file this row touches finds no credential, token or key value.

# DIRECTORY-004: Link two upstream providers to one Rauthy person

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-003
> **Blocked by:** The fork-owned brief for row 03's Rauthy changes, which does not yet exist: a brief in the ablative-io/rauthy fork's own repository (vendor/rauthy, branch ablative; maintenance owner Chippy, Waffles reviewing, docs/design/identity/RAUTHY-BASELINE.md:39) carrying the fork files R1 names. This brief is not executable until that brief exists and has landed on a gated fork commit, Waffles' review of this brief before it is dispatched (DIRECTORY-001 boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it)
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-009 — People sign in through a maintained Rauthy fork of our own — Rauthy authenticates people, and its one-provider-per-user limit is changed in a fork we maintain, ablative-io/rauthy, not contributed upstream as a prerequisite. The maintained branch is ablative, created from upstream v0.36.2 commit dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; the fork's main stays an untouched upstream mirror; lys pins an exact commit of ablative as the submodule vendor/rauthy. Upgrades rebase ablative onto upstream release tags only, each in its own gated row; no cherry-picks and no reset of main.
> **Checklist:**
> - C16 — The pinned fork commit links Google and GitHub to one unchanged Rauthy person, refuses every collision and replay, migrates both storages and audits each link atomically (ID001_LINK_PAIR, ID001_LINK_REFUSAL, ID001_LINK_MIGRATION, ID001_LINK_AUDIT).
> - C17 — The provider-link contract and the links report are written, and the report names the gated fork commit the pin moves to.
> **Stories:**
> - S5 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As a person signing in, I want Google and GitHub to resolve to the one me, so that adding a provider never splits me into two people or merges me with someone who shares my email.

## Purpose

Row 03 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5: Google and GitHub resolve to one Rauthy person, collisions are refused rather than merged by email, and each link and unlink is audited atomically and acknowledged by the receiver DIRECTORY-003 built. The linking change lives in the maintained fork (ADR-009), a repository of its own; this brief is the lys side of the row: the pin, the provider-link contract and the report.

## Task

Carry IDENTITY-001 revision 5 row 03 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:208-262). The fork's files are the fork-owned brief's (blocked_by) and are named in R1's spec with their owner, never listed in files (CN4). This brief moves vendor/rauthy to the fork commit that brief lands and gates (R1), and writes the provider-link contract and the links report (R2). Estimate: 10 focused implementer hours, revision 5's figure for the whole row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:261), shared between this brief and the fork-owned brief; no re-estimate, and the split is stated when the fork-owned brief is written. The row's live demonstration, ID001_LINK_LIVE, is a verification step after the row lands and holds DIRECTORY-005 (CN6).

## Requirements

### R1: Move the pin to the gated fork commit that links two providers to one person

THE SYSTEM SHALL move the vendor/rauthy submodule pin to a commit on the fork's ablative branch that carries the linking change and has passed the fork-owned brief's gate (ADR-009); the pin never names an ungated or cherry-picked commit.

The linking change, owned by the fork-owned brief and named here only (owner: the ablative-io/rauthy fork, maintained by Chippy with Waffles reviewing; paths relative to the fork's root, from revision 5's wall, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:216-238): src/api/src/auth_providers.rs, src/api_types/src/auth_providers.rs, src/api_types/src/users.rs, src/data/src/entity/auth_providers.rs, src/data/src/entity/users.rs, src/data/src/entity/mod.rs, src/data/src/entity/identity_links.rs, src/data/src/entity/identity_link_audit.rs, src/data/src/migration/inserts.rs, src/service/src/oidc/auth_providers/login_finish.rs, src/service/src/oidc/auth_providers/login_start.rs, frontend/src/api/types/auth_provider.ts, frontend/src/api/types/user.ts, frontend/src/lib/account/AccMain.svelte, frontend/src/lib/account/AccOther.svelte, frontend/src/lib/account/AccLinkedProviders.svelte, frontend/src/lib/admin/users/UserInfo.svelte, frontend/src/routes/providers/callback/+page.svelte, migrations/hiqlite/32_identity_links.sql, migrations/postgres/V27__identity_links.sql, tests/identity_links/. Its work, from revision 5 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:246-249): replace the single provider pair with a link relation unique on provider and subject, migrating existing links transactionally without changing Rauthy user IDs, with row 01's exact migration filenames confirmed before code starts; require an authenticated person, fresh reauthentication and a single-use target-bound linking intent, bind state, nonce, provider and callback, and reject identity collision instead of merging by matching email; update every reader row 01 found, including administrative deletion, export and import; list links, and unlink only after confirming the identity keeps a usable authentication or recovery method, preserving upstream account security controls; commit link or unlink and its audit provenance atomically through the minimal durable link-audit design selected in row 01, and label the audit complete only on an acknowledged Lys receipt from the DIRECTORY-003 receiver, so a duplicate delivery never creates another identity event.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_LINK_PAIR: Google then GitHub, and GitHub then Google, resolve to one unchanged user subject; sign out and back in through either provider and reopen storage.
- ID001_LINK_REFUSAL: same email with different subject, already-owned provider identity, replayed/cross-account intent, CSRF/nonce mismatch and final-login unlink are refused with no unintended link.
- ID001_LINK_MIGRATION: both supported storage migrations preserve IDs and links, restart safely after interruption and refuse incompatible schema versions by name.
- ID001_LINK_AUDIT: crash after database commit but before audit acknowledgement retains the outbox; delivery/retry yields one logical signed event. Audit outage is visible, never a false completed receipt.
- vendor/rauthy names a commit on the ablative branch whose fork gate passed, and the four identifiers above are each found in that commit's tests under vendor/rauthy/tests/identity_links/.

**Files:**
- modify: vendor/rauthy

**Checklist:**
- C16 — The pinned fork commit links Google and GitHub to one unchanged Rauthy person, refuses every collision and replay, migrates both storages and audits each link atomically (ID001_LINK_PAIR, ID001_LINK_REFUSAL, ID001_LINK_MIGRATION, ID001_LINK_AUDIT).

**Stories:**
- S5 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As a person signing in, I want Google and GitHub to resolve to the one me, so that adding a provider never splits me into two people or merges me with someone who shares my email.

### R2: Write the provider-link contract and the links report

THE SYSTEM SHALL write docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md, the typed contract between the fork's link audit and the DIRECTORY-003 receiver (stable source operation IDs, pending and acknowledged states, what an issuer observes as against what a person claims), and docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md, the report of the row: the fork commit the pin moves to, its gate result, the counted legs of each ID001_LINK_* case and the development install's release-and-advisory check (CN10). Both keep the file names revision 5 gives this row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:241-242).

**Acceptance:**
- docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md names every field the receiver reads and the states a link audit passes through, and the DIRECTORY-003 receiver's fixtures match it.
- docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md names the pinned fork commit, its gate result and the count of exercised legs per identifier, and records the release-and-advisory check of the install.

**Files:**
- create: docs/design/identity/PROVIDER-LINK-CONTRACT.md
- create: docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-links.md

**Checklist:**
- C17 — The provider-link contract and the links report are written, and the report names the gated fork commit the pin moves to.

**Stories:**
- S5 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As a person signing in, I want Google and GitHub to resolve to the one me, so that adding a provider never splits me into two people or merges me with someone who shares my email.

## Boundaries

- Only the files listed in this brief's requirements change; a row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and Waffles approves a brief revision before that file is edited (CN9).
- Development isolation: disposable test identities and test provider registrations only; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration (CN2).
- No credential, token or key value is written in code, tests, fixtures, logs or documents; tests use generated values that are never real credentials.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- A live demonstration to Tom is a verification step a person performs after the row lands, never an acceptance criterion and never claimed by a loop completion (CN5, CN6).
- No row is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it.
- No fork file is edited by this brief: the fork's changes land through the fork-owned brief and its gate, and reach this repository only as a pin.
- No cherry-pick and no nightly base: rows 02 to 05 run on v0.36.2 (CN10).

## Verification

- From the repository root: cargo fmt --check; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps, all clean (CLAUDE.md, gates before any commit).
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0.
- From the repository root, with submodules checked out: rg -n 'ID001_LINK_PAIR|ID001_LINK_REFUSAL|ID001_LINK_MIGRATION|ID001_LINK_AUDIT' vendor/rauthy/tests/identity_links finds each identifier in a test.
- ID001_LINK_LIVE, after the row lands (CN5, CN6): a person installs the exact gated fork and shows Tom two linked providers resolving to one person in Rauthy's own account page, signing in through both, then posts a separate install and showing receipt to Tom with the Melbourne pass time, fork ref, artifact hash and observed result. A venue test or screenshot alone does not replace the live demonstration, and DIRECTORY-005 stays blocked until the receipt is recorded.

# DIRECTORY-005: Complete the standalone screen journey

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-004
> **Blocked by:** ID001_LINK_LIVE: Tom's live demonstration of row 03 (DIRECTORY-004), recorded by its posted install and showing receipt with the Melbourne pass time, fork ref, artifact hash and observed result; a loop completion never stands in for it (CN6), Waffles' review of this brief before it is dispatched (DIRECTORY-001 boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it), The exact file manifest for surface/identity/, reviewed before this row starts (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:28)
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
> - ADR-007 — The product starts an agent by giving its start command, never by running it — The product is not an execution engine. For the first release an agent's file gives the command that starts it on a chosen machine: the command carries the agent's identity and its handles, never a credential's value, and it is rendered from the agent's kept launch record. A started agent reports back, so the sessions screen shows what is running. A terminal inside the product, sandboxes, virtual machines and containers are later runtimes that plug in, and none is built into this product.
> - ADR-008 — An agent's file shows its lys certificate — An agent's file shows its lys certificate once one is issued: what it claims, who signed it, when it was issued and when it expires, with the signed receipts of the changes made to it. An agent registered before any key or proof of possession was supplied shows its certificate as not issued, never a placeholder.
> - ADR-010 — Every product shares one design and keeps its own accent; the identity product's is orange — The identity screens follow Aion's structure, typography, spacing and interaction, and Rauthy's client themes take the same colours, with no build dependency on Cambium or Aion. Each product keeps its own accent within the estate colour family: Cambium green, Aion blue and black, Argus light blue, Haematite mustard. The identity product's accent is orange (accent #D4975A, deep #A86B2E, wash #3D2A17 in the estate colour tokens), set apart from Manifold's copper. No product is silently made Aion-blue, and purple is not used.
> **Checklist:**
> - C18 — The standalone journey (sign in, the directory, a record, registering and editing an agent, linked accounts, signed history) works with Cambium and Manifold absent, each agent showing its responsible person (ID001_STANDALONE).
> - C19 — Expired login, unauthorized edit, provider collision, audit pending and backend outage each have a visible, actionable outcome and no optimistic completed state (ID001_SCREEN_REFUSAL).
> - C20 — The screens follow Aion's appearance with the identity product's own orange accent and no build dependency on Cambium or Aion (ADR-010).
> **Stories:**
> - S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.
> - S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.
> - S6 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want the directory's screens to show every refusal, pending audit and outage as it is, so that I never act on a completed state that did not happen.

## Purpose

Row 05 of IDENTITY-001 revision 5: the standalone product's own screens, 'beyond just a login page', so an operator installs, signs in, links two providers, registers an agent and reads its signed history with Cambium and Manifold absent. Revised for the grant ruling (ADR-003): each agent shows the person responsible for it, and the screen does not present access or delegation it cannot yet grant.

## Task

Carry IDENTITY-001 revision 5 row 05 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:263-294) into requirements: the screen journey (R1), visible refusals (R2) and the appearance (R3). Estimate: 6 focused implementer hours, revision 5's figure for this row (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:293); no re-estimate. surface/identity/ is a wholly new module: its exact file manifest is reviewed before the row starts (CN9). The row's live demonstration, ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE, is a verification step after the row lands and is the design's hold point before any row 06 (CN6). Every path is relative to the repository root.

## Requirements

### R1: Build the standalone screen journey

THE SYSTEM SHALL build sign-in, the directory of people and agents, record detail, register and edit agent, the linked-account entry point and signed change history in surface/identity/, served by crates/lys-identity-server/src/routes.rs and crates/lys-identity-server/src/assets.rs, with boundary types generated from the server schema, preserving shared lifecycle extension points without implementing Archie's screens (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:280). Registration states what has been created. Revised for the grant ruling (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:21, Chippy 17:17, agreed): each agent's record shows its responsible person and its recorded lifecycle state (ADR-011, proposed); where the statement's first screen shows the access granted and the delegation rights beside the responsible person, step 1 shows them as not yet available, never as empty working controls. An agent's certificate shows as not issued, never a placeholder (ADR-008). Controls for launch, a start command (ADR-007), live permissions, secrets and memory are not presented as working in step 1 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:282). deploy/identity/README.md gains the screen's install and use, and docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-standalone.md records the row's evidence.

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_STANDALONE: with Cambium and Manifold absent, an operator installs, signs in, links two providers, creates an agent, returns after restart and finds the same records and inspectable change history.
- Use the native browser against the installed venue artifact; record screenshots and observed actions plus artifact hashes in docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-standalone.md. A mockup or frontend build alone is not this acceptance.
- Each agent's record shows its responsible person and its recorded lifecycle state; its access and delegation rights show as not available in step 1, never as empty working controls; its certificate shows as not issued; no control for launch, permissions, secrets or memory is presented as working.

**Files:**
- create: surface/identity/
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/src/assets.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/src/routes.rs
- create: docs/design/identity/reports/IDENTITY-001-standalone.md
- modify: deploy/identity/README.md

**Checklist:**
- C18 — The standalone journey (sign in, the directory, a record, registering and editing an agent, linked accounts, signed history) works with Cambium and Manifold absent, each agent showing its responsible person (ID001_STANDALONE).

**Stories:**
- S1 (Responsible person, Signs in and provisions agents under their own authority) — As the responsible person, I want every grant my agent holds to trace back to me, so that withdrawing my authority stops everything derived from it.
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

### R2: Show every refusal, pending audit and outage as it is

THE SYSTEM SHALL show provider-link audit pending, unavailable services and named refusals accurately, with an actionable visible outcome for each and no optimistic completed state after a refusal (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:281, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:286; P5).

**Acceptance:**
- ID001_SCREEN_REFUSAL: expired login, unauthorized edit, provider collision, audit-pending and backend outage have actionable visible outcomes; no optimistic completed state after refusal.

**Files:**
- create: surface/identity/

**Checklist:**
- C19 — Expired login, unauthorized edit, provider collision, audit pending and backend outage each have a visible, actionable outcome and no optimistic completed state (ID001_SCREEN_REFUSAL).

**Stories:**
- S6 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want the directory's screens to show every refusal, pending audit and outage as it is, so that I never act on a completed state that did not happen.

### R3: Follow Aion's appearance with the identity product's own accent

THE SYSTEM SHALL follow Aion's structure, DM Sans and JetBrains Mono typography, radii, spacing and browser interaction conventions, with the identity product's own orange accent instead of Aion-blue (ADR-010; docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:281). Neutral design values keep their pinned provenance and the accent values are separately declared, read from the estate colour tokens (docs/design-system-v2/palette/estate-colour-tokens.json in the ablative docs repository, owner Waffles; named, not listed in files, CN4), with no build dependency on Cambium or Aion. Central design-system extraction is outside this brief.

**Acceptance:**
- The screens' accent values are the identity orange of the estate tokens with their recorded source ref; no Aion-blue accent and no purple appear, and the frontend build names no Cambium or Aion package.

**Files:**
- create: surface/identity/

**Checklist:**
- C20 — The screens follow Aion's appearance with the identity product's own orange accent and no build dependency on Cambium or Aion (ADR-010).

**Stories:**
- S3 (Operator, Installs and runs the standalone identity product) — As the operator, I want to install the identity product's dependencies on one PostgreSQL database whose host I choose, and restart or restore it without losing anyone, so that the product stands alone without Cambium or Manifold.

## Boundaries

- Only the files listed in this brief's requirements change; a row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and Waffles approves a brief revision before that file is edited (CN9).
- Development isolation: disposable test identities and test provider registrations only; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration (CN2).
- No credential, token or key value is written in code, tests, fixtures, logs or documents; tests use generated values that are never real credentials.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- A live demonstration to Tom is a verification step a person performs after the row lands, never an acceptance criterion and never claimed by a loop completion (CN5, CN6).
- No row is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it.
- Archie's lifecycle screens are not implemented; their extension points are kept.
- No grant, launch, secret or memory control is presented as working in step 1.

## Verification

- From the repository root: cargo fmt --check; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps, all clean (CLAUDE.md, gates before any commit).
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0.
- From the repository root: rg -n 'ID001_STANDALONE|ID001_SCREEN_REFUSAL' surface/identity finds each identifier in a test.
- ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE, after the row lands (CN5, CN6): a person installs the gated standalone directory and completes its journey with Tom in a live browser, then posts a separate line to Tom with the Melbourne pass time, installed refs and hashes and what was demonstrated, before any row 06 starts; no deferral to row 07. This is the design's hold point: the brief that follows is blocked by it until Tom's receipt is recorded, and the choice of Rauthy base recorded in the design's non-goals falls due at this showing if no suitable upstream release exists (CN10).
- Frontend checks pass with strict types and the generated API schema, with negative and crash-boundary tests.

# DIRECTORY-006: Enforce human-rooted grants, explicit delegation and the You-page access journey

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-002, DIRECTORY-003
> **Blocked by:** Waffles review of every requirement and the accepted mock-up/conformance snapshot before dispatch., DIRECTORY-002 and DIRECTORY-003 are published foundation briefs, not implemented foundations. DIRECTORY-003 must establish the identity crates, reviewed event envelope and server integration manifest; reconcile every future modify path below against its landed implementation before dispatch. The listed new grant modules do not exist in current source., Surface integration waits for DIRECTORY-005 to establish surface/identity and its route/type-generation paths. R6 cannot dispatch before that dependency; DIRECTORY-005 must not depend on R6, so backend grant work and screen integration have separate readiness., Reviewed grant representation, root-authority bootstrap and SpiceDB consistency contract remain open in DIRECTORY-001C5 and ADR-003. Behavioural tests below constrain that design; they do not authorise freezing a cryptographic format., Lifecycle suspension semantics and role version policy are supplied by their reviewed ADRs. Reinstatement safety and expiry invariants here do not settle their remaining policy choices., Review of the proposed R1 grant schema and R4 freshness mechanism; their additional fields and consistency strategy are proposals, not existing settled policy.
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
> - ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
> - ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL, possibly on a network device — PostgreSQL is used for the identity product's database. It may be set up on one of the network devices rather than on Tom's Mac.
> **Checklist:**
> - C21 — The proposed application grant schema separates exercise and pass-on authority; its additional fields require independent review before dispatch and do not change published crypto formats.
> - C22 — Delegation requires an explicit permission to delegate to the requested subject kind; use-only, absent policy and owner labels cannot create it.
> - C23 — Every grant is bounded by a live, acyclic ancestry to a responsible person; scope is evaluated by model actions/resources, never display-name rank.
> - C24 — Grant changes and their audit share one durable authoritative event; retries and uncertain outcomes preserve operation identity and replay-equivalent projections.
> - C25 — Revocation stops derived authority while independent authority remains usable; the proposed revision-freshness mechanism is reviewed before dispatch.
> - C26 — Inherited expiry and provisional end dates are enforced at admission; role changes and reinstatement cannot resurrect expired or revoked authority.
> - C27 — Typed browser/API/agent seams use one authenticated evaluator; forward and reverse explanations name the same authority path and revision without private-record leakage.
> - C28 — Observed grant usage names its source and time; not seen is not reported as never used.
> - C29 — The You and delegation screens show real server authority, separate service accounts from sign-in identities, and preserve personal versus administrator visibility.
> - C30 — The accepted mock-up conformance is tested through actual requests, refusals, pending outcomes, keyboard paths and durable read-back rather than simulated success.
> **Stories:**
> - S8 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a responsible person, I want to give my agent a bounded part of my authority and revoke it, so the same action is allowed before revocation and refused after it.
> - S9 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person or agent with use-only permission, I want the service to explain why I cannot pass it on; with explicit pass-on rights I want the same permitted operation available through UI and tools.
> - S10 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As an auditor, I want grant changes and retries tied to one durable signed operation, so restart or an uncertain reply cannot invent, lose or duplicate authority.
> - S11 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person granting temporary access, I want its end date and ancestor restrictions enforced, so role changes or reinstatement cannot silently extend it.
> - S12 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As an authorised reviewer, I want to ask why this identity can act and who can reach a resource using the same current decision, without exposing records I may not inspect.

## Purpose

Make the human-rooted grant path enforceable: sign in, give an agent a bounded permission, prove the action works, revoke the source, and prove the same action is refused. Use and lending are separate positive rights and the screen explains the real server decision. Authority for this amendment: docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md at commit 1353c22, rows 1.3, 1.4, 2.1–2.6 and 7.3. Context only: Tom requested complete briefs tied to the mock-up on 23 September 2026 at 19:04:22 Melbourne, then the right Cambium boards and workflows at 19:10:35; these conversational times are not repository evidence.

## Task

Implement R1–R5 in order after the directory/service foundations, then R6 after the standalone surface foundation. Estimated work: R1 2h, R2 3h (ancestry/refusal matrix), R3 4h (forced durability boundaries), R4 3h (freshness and expiry), R5 2h, R6 3h (two-person browser evidence), total 17 hours as a new increment, not silently inside IDENTITY-001's 48-hour ceiling. Estimates are proposals for review. Exact file walls follow the new crate roots already named by IDENTITY-001 rows 04/05; none is asserted implemented. Every future modify path must be reconciled to those dependencies' actual manifests before dispatch. Preserve all ID001 requirements in their owning predecessor briefs and the frozen IDENTITY-001 history. In scope: domain grants, authority enforcement, durable audit, explanation API and You/delegation UI. Out: provider federation changes, secret-value storage/proxy, actual process execution, assistant actions, graph renderer and published cryptographic format changes.

## Requirements

### R1: Define the reviewed grant contract without changing published cryptography

PROPOSAL FOR REVIEW, not a settled grant schema: define a typed application grant contract that identifies the grant, issuer, holder, responsible person, resource, exercisable actions, explicit pass-on authority and permitted recipient kinds, source grant, time window, policy revision and authorising audit event. Exercising an action and delegating it SHALL be separate decisions. A missing pass-on field SHALL NOT mean permission. Relations SHALL resolve through the reviewed model to action/resource sets; the code SHALL NOT infer a global owner/editor/viewer rank from display strings. Before any durable grant is signed, the event envelope, canonical encoding, root-authority bootstrap and lineage semantics SHALL be independently reviewed. This row defines application-domain types in lys-identity; it SHALL NOT reinterpret seat/speaks-for or mutate lys/delegation/v1, which currently supplies neither this capability schema nor an expiry. Provenance: ADR-003; STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md, Everything is pegged to a human authority; PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md, What one grant says. Conformance 1.3, 1.4, 2.2, 2.3. The extra holder, responsible-person, recipient-kind, time-window, policy-revision and authorising-event fields are design proposals in this row; PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md supplies five source facts and leaves representation open. This row and GRANT_CONTRACT cannot be dispatched until independent contract review ratifies the schema. Checkable conformance source: docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md at commit 1353c22.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_CONTRACT: serialise/parse a grant with each declared member and independently supplied schema fixture; unknown members, absent required authority, malformed lineage and unknown recipient kinds refuse by name. Count each case; no permission is supplied by a deserialisation default.
- GRANT_MODEL: define two model relations whose names do not imply their action sets. A requested subset is checked against the model, not lexical order or a hard-coded rank; model version is retained in the decision.
- GRANT_WIRE_BOUNDARY: an explicit reviewed application-envelope identifier precedes the first durable signed grant. Existing published lys wire-vector tests remain byte-identical; an unratified delegation format is not used as a substitute capability token.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/mod.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/types.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/error.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_contract.rs
- create: docs/design/identity/GRANT-CONTRACT.md
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/lib.rs

**Checklist:**
- C21 — The proposed application grant schema separates exercise and pass-on authority; its additional fields require independent review before dispatch and do not change published crypto formats.

**Stories:**
- S8 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a responsible person, I want to give my agent a bounded part of my authority and revoke it, so the same action is allowed before revocation and refused after it.

### R2: Enforce affirmative delegation and bounded ancestry

WHEN a person or agent asks to delegate authority, THE SYSTEM SHALL check the actor's current exercise and delegation rights, requested resource/actions and recipient kind against every effective ancestor, ending at an authorised person. The requested authority SHALL be an explicit subset, never inherited wholesale. A use-only grant, an owner label, missing prohibition or access to the UI SHALL NOT establish pass-on authority. People-only authority SHALL refuse agents even when the person owns that agent. Unknown parents, cycles, wrong responsible persons and attempts to launder authority through a new role, secret handle or sibling grant SHALL refuse before any mutation. An agent that holds explicit pass-on permission may invoke the same operation as a person; being an agent alone is not either a permit or a categorical prohibition. The policy determines recipients rather than the mock-up's sample restriction to the caller's own agents. Provenance: ADR-003; AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md. Conformance 2.1–2.4, 7.3. Secret lending also recognises server-verified real ownership as the affirmative route in docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md at commit 1353c22 row 7.3; a display label is not that ownership record.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_USE_VS_LEND: Tom may read a project through Dana's use-only grant. His read succeeds; browser, direct API and agent-tool attempts to grant that access to his agent all refuse and create zero grant events. Add a distinct affirmative pass-on grant: the bounded control now succeeds.
- GRANT_RECIPIENT: exercise human-only, agent-only and non-delegable grants with both recipient kinds. Assert each named permit/refusal and exact zero mutations on denied requests, including the owner's own agent case.
- GRANT_ANCESTRY: attempt a broader resource, broader action, a forged parent, a cycle, a changed responsible person and a revoked ancestor. Each refuses with the blocking boundary. A two-hop permitted narrower chain succeeds and explains its actual ancestors.
- GRANT_AGENT_PARITY: the same authenticated authority and request produce the same effective decision through browser/API/tool routes. An agent granted pass-on can delegate inside that grant; an agent without it cannot.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/admission.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/lineage.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/authority.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_delegation.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C22 — Delegation requires an explicit permission to delegate to the requested subject kind; use-only, absent policy and owner labels cannot create it.
- C23 — Every grant is bounded by a live, acyclic ancestry to a responsible person; scope is evaluated by model actions/resources, never display-name rank.

**Stories:**
- S8 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a responsible person, I want to give my agent a bounded part of my authority and revoke it, so the same action is allowed before revocation and refused after it.
- S9 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person or agent with use-only permission, I want the service to explain why I cannot pass it on; with explicit pass-on rights I want the same permitted operation available through UI and tools.

### R3: Commit grants and their audit as one replayable operation

THE SYSTEM SHALL record a grant mutation as one signed authoritative event using DIRECTORY-003's reviewed event owner, and derive both the directory projection and the permission projection from that event. A database write followed by best-effort audit is forbidden. Each mutation SHALL carry a stable operation ID; the same ID and payload returns the same logical outcome, while changed payload under that ID refuses. Unknown append or projection outcomes SHALL remain named and retained for reconciliation; the API SHALL NOT manufacture success or issue a fresh operation when acknowledgement is lost. Any read or admission that depends on unresolved authority SHALL refuse naming the affected grant/operation; unrelated authority stays usable. Projection progress SHALL record the minimum revision required for a fresh decision, including across restart. Provenance: directory principlesP4/P5 and ID001_AUDIT_FAULTS; conformance1.4,8.1.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_DURABILITY: enumerate every append, sync, authoritative-event and projection boundary in the implementation and inject a failure at each. Count the legs. Every answered grant/permission read equals replay, while unresolved reads name the grant/operation. Unrelated grant controls still succeed.
- GRANT_IDEMPOTENCE: lose acknowledgement after commit, retry identical ID/payload, reopen and retry again. One logical grant and one authorising event remain. A changed payload under the same ID refuses and changes neither projection.
- GRANT_AUDIT: independently verify a grant mutation receipt; tampering with actor, source grant, recipient, resource/actions, sequence or signature is rejected. A refusal never appears as a successful grant event.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/events.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/projection.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/recovery.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_faults.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_receipts.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C24 — Grant changes and their audit share one durable authoritative event; retries and uncertain outcomes preserve operation identity and replay-equivalent projections.

**Stories:**
- S10 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As an auditor, I want grant changes and retries tied to one durable signed operation, so restart or an uncertain reply cannot invent, lose or duplicate authority.

### R4: Enforce revocation, inherited expiry and current permission decisions

WHEN an ancestor is revoked or expires, THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse fresh exercise and further delegation through every grant derived from it. Independent grants to the same person or resource SHALL remain independent. Proposal under review: require a permission decision at least as fresh as the authoritative change, and refuse or await freshness rather than permit from a stale replica, unavailable engine or unresolved projection. The mechanism and choice must be settled before dispatch. Expiry SHALL be enforced at admission using the named clock, including inherited limits; a role edit or version move SHALL NOT renew a provisional grant. Reinstating a suspended identity SHALL recheck current ancestry and leases, never resurrect separately revoked or expired grants. Shared ancestor use/spend budgets are counted once by the broker in SECRETS-002 R9, never cloned into each descendant. The exact broader suspension policy remains the lifecycle ADR's, not a decision smuggled into this row. Conformance 2.5, 2.6, 3.3, 4.5.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_REVOKE: create a two-hop chain and an independently authorised sibling. A permitted action succeeds, then revoke the chain root and repeat exactly the same action for each descendant: every derived call refuses; the independent control succeeds.
- GRANT_EXPIRY: under a controlled clock, assert permit immediately before each relevant end boundary and refusal at/after it, including an earlier ancestor end. Neither editing a role nor selecting a newer role version extends the holding.
- GRANT_FRESHNESS: pause permission projection before applying a committed revoke; a caller presenting the required revision cannot obtain a permit from the old state. Resume projection and verify the named revoked decision after reopen.
- GRANT_REINSTATE: while an identity is suspended, revoke one grant and expire a second. After reinstatement both remain refused; only a third still-authorised control is usable. No renewal or issuance event is invented.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/revocation.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/expiry.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/permission.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_revocation.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_expiry.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/mod.rs

**Checklist:**
- C25 — Revocation stops derived authority while independent authority remains usable; the proposed revision-freshness mechanism is reviewed before dispatch.
- C26 — Inherited expiry and provisional end dates are enforced at admission; role changes and reinstatement cannot resurrect expired or revoked authority.

**Stories:**
- S8 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a responsible person, I want to give my agent a bounded part of my authority and revoke it, so the same action is allowed before revocation and refused after it.
- S11 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person granting temporary access, I want its end date and ancestor restrictions enforced, so role changes or reinstatement cannot silently extend it.

### R5: Expose one authenticated grant and explanation seam

THE SYSTEM SHALL expose typed operations for list/read, delegate, revoke and explain through the standalone identity server, all calling the same authority owner. API/tool access SHALL enforce the same checks as the UI; browser controls are presentation only. A why-permitted response SHALL identify actual authority path, responsible person, effective scope and policy revision; a why-refused response SHALL name the blocking condition without disclosing another identity's protected records. The reverse question, who can exercise this action on this resource, SHALL use the same evaluator and revision, with its own visibility permission. Incomplete pagination SHALL remain explicit. A last-use value reports observed use at named enforcement points; absence is not evidence of never-used. No live Cambium, Aion, Argus or Manifold is required. Conformance 8.1, 8.2, 8.4 and ADR-004.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_API_AUTH: unauthenticated, wrong issuer/subject, use-only and unauthorised-revoke requests are named refusals and create zero mutations. Exercise valid controls and count each route, rather than testing only button visibility.
- GRANT_EXPLAIN: the forward decision and reverse enumeration agree for the same resource/action/revision; paging returns every authorised holder exactly once and names continuation. Hidden private grants do not leak IDs, labels or existence to an unauthorised querier.
- GRANT_LAST_USED: an unobserved grant is labelled not seen; a recorded use reports its source/time; a missing reporting source is distinguished from a zero count. Reopen preserves the attribution.
- GRANT_STANDALONE: execute all operations against disposable local dependencies with other Ablative servers absent. Permission-engine outage is a named refusal, never an implicit standalone permit.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/src/grants.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/src/grant_contract.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/tests/grants.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/tests/grant_explanations.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity-server/src/routes.rs

**Checklist:**
- C27 — Typed browser/API/agent seams use one authenticated evaluator; forward and reverse explanations name the same authority path and revision without private-record leakage.
- C28 — Observed grant usage names its source and time; not seen is not reported as never used.

**Stories:**
- S9 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person or agent with use-only permission, I want the service to explain why I cannot pass it on; with explicit pass-on rights I want the same permitted operation available through UI and tools.
- S12 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As an authorised reviewer, I want to ask why this identity can act and who can reach a resource using the same current decision, without exposing records I may not inspect.

### R6: Implement the You and delegation screens from the server contract

THE SYSTEM SHALL render the accepted mock-up's You page and delegation form from the server's generated grant types and decisions. Show sign-in identities separately from service access, source grants, effective operations/resource, affirmative pass-on rights and inherited end boundary. The form SHALL explain refused choices the caller is allowed to discover; it SHALL NOT enumerate other people's private secrets merely to say no. Personal views are scoped to the signed-in person, while an independently authorised directory administrator may inspect the wider directory. A failed or uncertain mutation SHALL remain refused or pending, with the original operation ID, never an optimistic grant or a new retry. The access graph consumes the same explanation response; its rendering belongs to Archie's graph brief. No simulated confirmation timer or sample-data authority calculation ships. Conformance 1.3–1.5, 2.3–2.4, 8.1 and 8.4.

**Acceptance:**
- GRANT_SCREEN: using two test people and their agents, render the source grant, action/resource scope, pass-on decision and inherited expiry from fixture IDs. Switching the signed-in person changes the personal data; permitted administrator inspection remains possible through its separate route.
- GRANT_SCREEN_REFUSAL: a use-only source, excessive requested scope, people-only policy, expired ancestor and service outage are refused visibly with the server reason; the request count and record count prove no hidden mutation happened.
- GRANT_SCREEN_PENDING: withhold the acknowledgement after durable delegation. The page keeps the original operation pending, retries by that ID, and eventually shows one grant; it never changes to success on a timer.
- GRANT_CONFORMANCE: pin the accepted mock-up file hash and numbered conformance rows in the test evidence. Exercise keyboard operation and deep linking as well as API refusal parity; sample data and visual similarity alone are not a passing acceptance.

**Files:**
- create: surface/identity/src/features/grants/YouGrants.tsx
- create: surface/identity/src/features/grants/DelegateGrant.tsx
- create: surface/identity/src/features/grants/GrantExplanation.tsx
- create: surface/identity/tests/grants.test.tsx
- create: surface/identity/tests/acceptance/grants.spec.ts
- modify: surface/identity/src/routes.tsx
- modify: surface/identity/src/generated/index.ts

**Checklist:**
- C29 — The You and delegation screens show real server authority, separate service accounts from sign-in identities, and preserve personal versus administrator visibility.
- C30 — The accepted mock-up conformance is tested through actual requests, refusals, pending outcomes, keyboard paths and durable read-back rather than simulated success.

**Stories:**
- S8 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a responsible person, I want to give my agent a bounded part of my authority and revoke it, so the same action is allowed before revocation and refused after it.
- S9 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As a person or agent with use-only permission, I want the service to explain why I cannot pass it on; with explicit pass-on rights I want the same permitted operation available through UI and tools.
- S12 (Grant holder and reviewer, Exercises or delegates current authority and verifies its exact origin) — As an authorised reviewer, I want to ask why this identity can act and who can reach a resource using the same current decision, without exposing records I may not inspect.

## Boundaries

- A missing file or unreviewed integration seam is a named dispatch blocker; do not silently expand a row wall or label an empty integration ready.
- No real credentials, live operator account mutation or production service writes in tests; use disposable local providers and permission fixtures.
- Every mutation seam is typed and generated; UI and agent callers use the same server checks. Do not infer authority from email, display name, mock-up data or absence of a deny flag.
- The same grant cannot acquire more authority through delegation, a secret handle, role migration, retries or restart. Use, delegation and permission to inspect another identity are distinct.
- The source/mock-up is a conformance specification, not implementation evidence. A test or source-only review never substitutes for the required live demonstration.
- No code in lys-core or published wire format changes in this brief. A capability format decision requires its own independent adversarial review before durable signing.
- Waffles owns board placement and workflow connection review. Create a blocked card with this exact brief path; do not move it into a dispatching status until its named blockers and row review are resolved.

## Verification

- From docs/: python3 "$DS2_METHOD/scripts/validate.py" design/directory and python3 "$DS2_METHOD/scripts/check-coverage.py" design/directory. Render with render-cluster.py and verify a second render is byte-identical.
- At implementation time run the repository battery from the exact revision: fmt, strict default/all-feature Clippy, feature-full tests and both rustdoc shapes. Run the granted/refused matrix and report each exercised leg, fault ordinal and unrun check.
- After the relevant screen row lands, demonstrate sign-in, agent registration, permitted action, source revocation and refusal to Tom using installed artifact hashes; record Melbourne time and exact authority/operation/receipt IDs. This human verification is not an automated acceptance criterion.
- Review the Cambium card: Card key resolves this exact JSON brief; project board rule connects to the supported deployed workflow; blocker/status prevents premature dispatch. No live test run or duplicate submission is used merely to inspect the configuration.

# DIRECTORY-008: Grant brief residue after PR 6

> **Cluster:** directory
> **Depends on:** DIRECTORY-001
> **Blocked by:** Sign-off of this brief before it is dispatched (DIRECTORY-001 boundary: no row brief is dispatched until Waffles has reviewed it)
> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
> - ADR-009 — People sign in through a maintained Rauthy fork of our own — Rauthy authenticates people, and its one-provider-per-user limit is changed in a fork we maintain, ablative-io/rauthy, not contributed upstream as a prerequisite. The maintained branch is ablative, created from upstream v0.36.2 commit dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; the fork's main stays an untouched upstream mirror; lys pins an exact commit of ablative as the submodule vendor/rauthy. Upgrades rebase ablative onto upstream release tags only, each in its own gated row; no cherry-picks and no reset of main.
> **Checklist:**
> - C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
> - C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task.
> - C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.
> **Stories:**
> - S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

## Purpose

Three small items the 25 September grant-brief patch carries that main lacks after PR 6 (5593354) landed DIRECTORY-001 to DIRECTORY-006: the DIRECTORY-005 verification line for the frontend checks (R1), three design.json inventory rows for vendor/rauthy, crates/lys and docs/design/decisions.json beside the eight rows main lists (R2), and one design.json intention sentence recording that Cambium later uses this issuer keeping its participant ids, while the non-goal for rows 06 and 07 stands (R3). Main wins wherever the patch contradicts it on ADR ids and lifecycle; nothing here reopens a settled row. Documents only under docs/design/directory; no code; no new ADR; no change to any row's identifiers, estimates or dependency order.

## Task

Make the three document edits R1 to R3 on the documents as main holds them at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18 (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json:114-119, docs/design/directory/design.json:4 and docs/design/directory/design.json:580-613), re-render the cluster so each rendered twin matches its JSON, and pass the gate. Estimate: 1 focused implementer hour (R1 0.25, R2 0.5, R3 0.25), a document increment outside CN7's 48-hour ceiling, which stands unchanged; no row's estimate changes, DIRECTORY-005 keeps its 6 hours. Every path is relative to the repository root (CN3).

Ledger. Under the ruling of 26 September at 20:31 that a brief's ids are the next after main's highest and every open brief branch's, this brief is DIRECTORY-008 at docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-008.json and its roadmap row is RM-016 in docs/design/roadmap.json, appended after RM-015, which the audit receipt card's brief DIRECTORY-007 takes in the run fired beside this one; main's ledger ends at RM-010 (docs/design/roadmap.json:276) and RM-011 to RM-015 are taken on open brief branches, so RM-016 is appended as the next row with every row main holds unchanged. It records no new decision: docs/design/decisions.json is not touched. Per the settled answer B1 (round 1 of run a68a7767, 22:49): RM-016 is the brief's own ledger entry, which every brief on main has, written by the brief method the gate runs, as the brief file is written under docs/design/directory/briefs; the boundary 'documents only under docs/design/directory' governs the work R1 to R3 do when built, not the brief's own files; RM-016 is appended with every row main holds unchanged, and no other file outside docs/design/directory changes. The two structure rows for this brief's own files in design.json are the method's listing of the brief, as DIRECTORY-006's rows are (docs/design/directory/design.json:414-423), and are written on the brief branch, not by the build.

Coverage. C1, C3, C6 and S2 are claimed by DIRECTORY-001, which wrote these documents, and by this brief, which completes them with the three items; the split is noted here, as check-coverage.py allows, and is reported as a warning, not a failure.

Dev note. The build starts from the main this brief lands on, which may be later than 1756688 if DIRECTORY-007 lands first; the counts in R1 to R3 are stated against 1756688 and hold, because that brief's words touch neither DIRECTORY-005's verification nor design.json's inventory or intention. Read the four files first. Make each JSON edit as an append that keeps every existing member byte for byte: json.load, append, json.dump with indent=2 and ensure_ascii=False plus one trailing newline reproduces main's formatting exactly (checked at 1756688 for both files by a round trip). Then run python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory and commit the rendered DESIGN.md and DIRECTORY-005.md beside their JSON; the gate compares a fresh render against the committed markdown byte for byte. Run bash scripts/design/gate.sh last and commit the four files by exact path.

## Requirements

### R1: Add the frontend verification line to DIRECTORY-005

THE SYSTEM SHALL append to the verification array of docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json:114-119, four entries at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, the fourth being the ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE hold point) one fifth and last entry, exactly: 'Frontend checks pass with strict types and the generated API schema, with negative and crash-boundary tests.' The four entries main holds SHALL stay byte for byte and in their order. No other member of DIRECTORY-005 changes: not its id, depends_on, blocked_by, checklist, stories, design_anchor, purpose, task with its 6-hour estimate, requirements or boundaries. THE SYSTEM SHALL re-render docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md with python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory so its Verification section (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md:103-108 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18) lists the five entries.

**Acceptance:**
- From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json'))['verification']))" prints 5 (it prints 4 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18), and the first four entries equal, string for string, the four that git show 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18:docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json holds.
- From the repository root: rg -c 'strict types and the generated API schema' docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json prints 1, and the same command over docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md prints 1; both print nothing at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.
- From the repository root, on the build branch: git diff --no-ext-diff --numstat <base>..HEAD -- docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json prints 2 added and 1 deleted (the new entry's line and the fourth entry's line gaining its trailing comma), where <base> is the commit the build started from.
- From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json')); print(d['task'].count('6 focused implementer hours'), d['depends_on'])" prints 1 ['DIRECTORY-004'], as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md

**Checklist:**
- C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task.
- C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

#### R1 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Accept 1: met. The verification array has 5 entries, and the first four were left untouched by the append (the dump round trip is byte-identical, checked before editing). Accept 2: met. rg -c prints 1 for docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json (line 119) and 1 for DIRECTORY-005.md (line 109). Accept 3: met. The working-tree git diff --numstat for DIRECTORY-005.json is '2 1': the new line plus the fourth entry gaining its comma. Accept 4: met. The check prints 1 ['DIRECTORY-004'].
- Deviation: I ran python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory once, because R1 to R3 require the re-render and it is the only way to produce the rendered twins. I ran no other listed check, build, lint or test, and made no commit, as instructed.
- Files changed:
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json` — The verification array now holds five entries. The fifth, at line 119, is 'Frontend checks pass with strict types and the generated API schema, with negative and crash-boundary tests.' Every other member is unchanged.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md` — Re-rendered. The Verification section lists the five entries, with the new one at line 109.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C3 — Each open row (02, 04, 03, 05) is a design-system brief, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in dependency order, with its wall as files, its ID001 acceptance identifiers kept, and its estimate in its task. — DIRECTORY-005 keeps its id, depends_on, estimate and ID001 identifiers. Only the verification line was added.
  - [x] C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean. — The rendered twin was regenerated from the JSON.
- Story delivery:
  - [x] S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria. — The brief now carries the frontend verification line for review.

**Review (recorded):**

The phrase is absent at base.
  - [x] From the repository root, on the build branch: git diff --no-ext-diff --numstat <base>..HEAD -- docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json prints 2 added and 1 deleted (the new entry's line and the fourth entry's line gaining its trailing comma), where <base> is the commit the build started from. — git diff --no-ext-diff --numstat against base 3c1a3b9 (working tree, not yet committed) prints '2	1	docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json'.
  - [x] From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json')); print(d['task'].count('6 focused implementer hours'), d['depends_on'])" prints 1 ['DIRECTORY-004'], as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18. — Prints 1 ['DIRECTORY-004'].

### R2: Add the three inventory rows beside what main lists

THE SYSTEM SHALL append three rows to the inventory array of docs/design/directory/design.json (docs/design/directory/design.json:580-613, eight rows at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, ending with docs/design/identity/RAUTHY-BASELINE.md at docs/design/directory/design.json:606 and docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md at docs/design/directory/design.json:610), after the eight and in this order, each with its path and a note of what exists there at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18: (1) path 'vendor/rauthy', note 'the maintained Rauthy fork (ADR-009), the git submodule pinned at dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662, the upstream v0.36.2 commit the ablative branch was created from; DIRECTORY-004 moves the pin (structure row); read here, never changed by a document row'; (2) path 'crates/lys', note 'the lys CLI crate: Cargo.toml, src/main.rs, src/cli.rs and src/commands/ (attest, ca, key, log, inspect, files); DIRECTORY-002 adds src/identity/ and the identity subcommand to it (structure rows)'; (3) path 'docs/design/decisions.json', note 'the project decision ledger, ADR-001 to ADR-018 at main, holding the decisions this cluster cites (ADR-003, ADR-004, ADR-005, ADR-007 to ADR-011); DIRECTORY-001 recorded that it gained the identity decisions (structure row); read here, never changed by a document row'. The eight rows main lists SHALL stay byte for byte and in their order. No structure row, principle, goal, non-goal, constraint or gate leg changes. THE SYSTEM SHALL re-render docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md with python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory so its Inventory section (docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md:167-176 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18) lists the eleven rows.

**Acceptance:**
- From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json'))['inventory']))" prints 11 (it prints 8 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18), and the first eight rows equal, member for member, the eight that git show 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18:docs/design/directory/design.json holds.
- From the repository root: rg -c '"path": "vendor/rauthy"' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 2 (1 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, the structure row at docs/design/directory/design.json:380); rg -c '"path": "crates/lys"' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 1 (nothing at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18); rg -c '"path": "docs/design/decisions.json"' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 2 (1 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, the structure row at docs/design/directory/design.json:140).

- From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json')); print([r['path'] for r in d['inventory'][8:]])" prints ['vendor/rauthy', 'crates/lys', 'docs/design/decisions.json'], and rg -c 'RAUTHY-BASELINE.md"|CONFORMANCE.md"' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 2, as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/design.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md

**Checklist:**
- C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
- C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

#### R2 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Accept 1: met. len(inventory) is 11, and the first eight rows were left unchanged by the append. Accept 2: met. '"path": "vendor/rauthy"' counts 2 (lines 380 and 624), '"path": "crates/lys"' counts 1 (line 628), and '"path": "docs/design/decisions.json"' counts 2 (lines 140 and 632). Accept 3: met. Each of the three '^- `...`' patterns matches once in DESIGN.md, at lines 179, 180 and 181. Accept 4: met. inventory[8:] paths are ['vendor/rauthy', 'crates/lys', 'docs/design/decisions.json'], and the RAUTHY-BASELINE and CONFORMANCE rows were not touched, so that count stays 2.
- Deviation: (none)
- Files changed:
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/design.json` — The inventory now holds eleven rows. Rows 9 to 11 (lines 624, 628 and 632) are vendor/rauthy, crates/lys and docs/design/decisions.json, each with the note exactly as specified. The intention also changed, under R3.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md` — Re-rendered. The Inventory section lists the eleven rows, with the new three at lines 179 to 181.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling. — The inventory now also records the fork, the CLI crate and the decision ledger. No other design member changed.
  - [x] C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean. — DESIGN.md was re-rendered from design.json.
- Story delivery:
  - [x] S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria. — Reviewers can see what the rows read and move.

### R3: Record the Cambium direction in the intention while the non-goal stands

THE SYSTEM SHALL append one sentence to the intention of docs/design/directory/design.json (docs/design/directory/design.json:4 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, one sentence ending 'every identity change.'), after one space, exactly: 'Cambium later uses this issuer, keeping its participant ids (rows 06 and 07); that direction is recorded here while rows 06 and 07 stay the non-goal recorded below, and this sentence promises neither row.' The non-goal for rows 06 and 07 (docs/design/directory/design.json:63-66, text 'Rows 06 (connect Cambium) and 07 (gate, install and demonstrate the release)' with its reason) SHALL stay byte for byte; no other member of the intention, and no goal, principle, non-goal, structure row, constraint or gate leg, changes. THE SYSTEM SHALL re-render docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md with python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory so its Intention section (docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md:11-13 at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18) carries the sentence.

**Acceptance:**
- From the repository root: rg -c 'keeping its participant ids' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 1 and the same command over docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md prints 1; both print nothing at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.
- From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; i=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json'))['intention']; print(i.startswith('An operator installs the identity product without Cambium or Manifold, signs in,') and i.endswith('and this sentence promises neither row.'))" prints True.
- From the repository root: rg -c 'Rows 06 \(connect Cambium\) and 07 \(gate, install and demonstrate the release\)' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 1, as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18, and python3 -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json'))['non_goals']))" prints 11, as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.
- From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json')); print(len(d['goals']), len(d['principles']), len(d['constraints']))" prints 5 9 12, as at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18.

**Files:**
- modify: docs/design/directory/design.json
- modify: docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md

**Checklist:**
- C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling.
- C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean.

**Stories:**
- S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria.

#### R3 — Execution record

**Dev (recorded):**

- Status: implemented
- How: Accept 1: met. 'keeping its participant ids' counts 1 in design.json (line 4) and 1 in DESIGN.md. Accept 2: met. The intention starts with the operator sentence and ends with 'and this sentence promises neither row.' Accept 3: met. The non-goals were not edited, so the Rows 06/07 text is still present and non_goals still has 11 entries (measured). Accept 4: met. goals, principles and constraints measure 5, 9 and 12.
- Deviation: (none)
- Files changed:
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/design.json` — At line 4 the intention now ends with one space and then the exact Cambium sentence. The non-goals were not changed.
  - modified: `docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md` — Re-rendered. The Intention section (line 13) carries the sentence.
- Checklist delivery:
  - [x] C1 — The directory design records the outcome, the shared contract as principles, the constraints and the non-goals of IDENTITY-001, revised for the grant ruling. — The outcome now records the Cambium direction, and the non-goal is kept.
  - [x] C6 — The rendered markdown of this cluster matches its JSON and coverage is clean. — DESIGN.md was re-rendered.
- Story delivery:
  - [x] S2 (Reviewer, Reviews a brief before any of its rows is dispatched) — As the reviewer, I want each open identity row as a design-system brief with numbered requirements and criteria, so that rows can be dispatched to the loop one at a time and reviewed against their criteria. — The direction is recorded without promising any row.

**Review (recorded):**

- Alignment: aligned
- Acceptance verdicts:
  - [x] From the repository root: rg -c 'keeping its participant ids' docs/design/directory/design.json prints 1 and the same command over docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md prints 1; both print nothing at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18. — Prints 1 for design.json and 1 for DESIGN.md.
  - [x] From the repository root: python3 -c "import json; i=json.load(open('docs/design/directory/design.json'))['intention']; print(i.startswith('An operator installs the identity product without Cambium or Manifold, signs in,') and i.endswith('and this sentence promises neither row.'))" prints True. — Prints True. The intention also equals the base intention + ' ' + the exact spec sentence (True).

## Boundaries

- Documents only under docs/design/directory: the build changes exactly the four files R1 to R3 name (docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json, docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md, docs/design/directory/design.json, docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md) and nothing else; no code; no file under crates/, surface/, deploy/, vendor/, scripts/ or tests/; docs/design/decisions.json is not touched either, narrower than CN1.
- No new ADR: docs/design/decisions.json is unchanged; this brief's design_anchor cites decisions that exist at 1756688cc08169bef4a9ac37b9b079efb9e38b18 and it records no decision.
- No change to any row's identifiers, estimates or dependency order: every brief id, roadmap id, ADR id, C, S, R and ID001 identifier, every estimate (DIRECTORY-005's 6 hours, CN7's ceiling) and every depends_on array stays as main holds it.
- Main wins wherever the 25 September patch contradicts it on ADR ids and lifecycle: nothing from the patch beyond the three items is carried, and no settled row reopens.
- The non-goal for rows 06 and 07 stands: the intention sentence records a direction and promises no row, no Cambium cluster and no cross-repository arrangement.
- Nothing open for Tom is decided: every decision the design's non-goals record as open stays open.
- The roadmap row RM-016 in docs/design/roadmap.json is this brief's own ledger entry, written on the brief branch by this brief and never by the build; per the settled answer B1 of 22:49 it stands outside the 'documents only under docs/design/directory' boundary, which governs the build's work (R1 to R3). The build changes no file outside docs/design/directory.
- No credential, token or key value is written in any document.
- No row is dispatched until this brief is signed off.

## Verification

- From the repository root: bash scripts/design/gate.sh exits 0 (scripts/design/gate.sh: validate.py over docs/design/decisions.json, docs/design/project.json and every cluster, check-coverage.py over every cluster, and render-cluster.py into a temporary copy compared byte for byte with the committed markdown).
- From the repository root, on the build branch: git diff --no-ext-diff --name-only <base>..HEAD prints exactly four paths, docs/design/directory/DESIGN.md, docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.json, docs/design/directory/briefs/DIRECTORY-005.md and docs/design/directory/design.json, where <base> is the commit the build started from; git diff --no-ext-diff --name-only <base>..HEAD -- . ':!docs/design/directory' prints nothing.
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/validate.py docs/design/directory and python3 scripts/design/check-coverage.py docs/design/directory exit 0; the coverage report may list C1, C3, C6 and S2 as claimed by DIRECTORY-001 and DIRECTORY-008, a warning whose split this brief's task notes, and lists no failure.
- From the repository root: python3 scripts/design/render-cluster.py docs/design/directory run a second time changes no file (git status --porcelain docs/design/directory prints nothing after it).

> **Design anchor:**
> - ADR-001 — Secrets are held behind a handle the door swaps for the credential — A seat holds a short-lived handle bound to its identity. The real credential sits in the door's encrypted store and never leaves the server. The door's proxy checks SpiceDB, swaps the handle for the credential, forwards the call and writes one audit line. Built in Rust inside the door; no OpenBao unless credentials minted on demand are later needed.
> - ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
> - ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
> - ADR-009 — People sign in through a maintained Rauthy fork of our own — Rauthy authenticates people, and its one-provider-per-user limit is changed in a fork we maintain, ablative-io/rauthy, not contributed upstream as a prerequisite. The maintained branch is ablative, created from upstream v0.36.2 commit dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; the fork's main stays an untouched upstream mirror; lys pins an exact commit of ablative as the submodule vendor/rauthy. Upgrades rebase ablative onto upstream release tags only, each in its own gated row; no cherry-picks and no reset of main.
> - ADR-011 — An identity is registered, active, suspended or retired — An identity is in one of four states: registered (exists in the directory, no grants, no credential handle, may not act), active (may act within its grants), suspended (kept whole, grants kept but not effective) and retired (permanent, history kept, never reactivated; a new identity is made instead). Register, activate, suspend, reinstate and retire are the only transitions, each one signed audit record naming the authenticated actor and their provenance, the identity, from, to, when and reason. Having a grant or a credential is a fact beside the state, not a state. A person is registered by first sign-in; an agent is registered by a signed-in person, who carries it as its responsible person for life and may cause every transition of their own agents. Source: docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:17-44 and docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:71-95.
> - ADR-105 — Sign-in identities belong to people only; the harness login token is the one named exception — A sign-in identity, a provider account linked to a person in the directory, belongs to that person only: lys never links, delegates or issues from it to an agent, and refuses each such act of its own by name. An agent's own machine account, bound to no person, is a service account and stays allowed. An issuer and subject is bound to one holder, whichever came first. The harness login token recorded at docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:43 and :167 and docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md:18 is the one named exception; it never passes through anything lys issues, links or delegates, and it is not redefined. Rejected: letting a person lend a sign-in identity to their own agent, and redefining the login token so the rule could be claimed without an exception.
> **Checklist:**
> - C313 — Binding to an agent a provider account linked to a person is refused by name and writes nothing, while an agent's own machine account, linked to no person, is accepted as its issuer-subject binding.
> - C314 — A person's link of a provider account the directory already binds to an agent is refused by name, stating that the account is an agent's own account; the agent's binding stands, and the agent is named in the directory's history to its responsible person and a directory administrator, never to the person trying to link.
> - C315 — Delegating from a sign-in identity is refused by name for an agent recipient and for a person recipient, while a service-access grant consented through the same provider account is admitted by the grant rules alone.
> - C316 — The explanation seam lists each of a person's sign-in identities on the cannot-give list with the reason 'sign-in identity', whoever the recipient is.
> - C317 — A sign-in identity refusal shows the provider and subject to the identity's owner and a directory administrator only; anyone else sees the act, the recipient and that a sign-in identity is involved.
> - C318 — Each refusal of an act that would give an agent a sign-in identity leaves the log and projection unchanged, and one counted test over the store after the two directory refusals finds no agent record carrying a sign-in identity.
> **Stories:**
> - S136 (Person who signs in, Keeps their sign-in identities to themselves) — As a person who signs in with a provider account, I want the directory to refuse every act that would give that account to an agent, so that no agent can ever hold my sign-in.

## Purpose

Conformance row 1.2 says a sign-in identity is never lent to or held by an agent. A sign-in identity is a person's link to a provider, such as a Google or GitHub account, through which that person signs in. IDENTITY-001 was to state this and never did, and no brief tests it. The directory holds sign-in identities beside people (DIRECTORY-004 links two providers to one person) and gives grants to agents (DIRECTORY-006), so the refusal belongs at the point where anything would attach a sign-in identity to an agent. In the directory a sign-in identity is a provider account, an issuer and subject (P1), linked to a person, and only that is refused; sign-in identities belong to people only (ADR-105). The directory enforces the two acts it owns, linking a provider account to an agent and delegating a grant whose source is a sign-in identity, each refused by name, each writing nothing, and one counted test over the store after those two directory refusals finds no agent record carrying a sign-in identity. The third act, issuing an agent a credential derived from a person's sign-in session, is the broker's (ADR-001): this brief states it as a finding against SECRETS-002 and does not enforce it. This brief names row 1.2 as the row it passes. Row 1.2 is tested in part by this brief's card, and is met in full only when the broker's line (finding 1 in the task) passes on the broker's card.

## Task

Build R1 to R7 in order, once DIRECTORY-003, DIRECTORY-004 and DIRECTORY-006 have landed on lys main (blocked_by gives the one command that checks each). R1 classifies an issuer-subject pair from the directory's signed history; R2 is the one refusal value and its two views; R3 refuses a person's provider account as an agent's binding and accepts an agent's own machine account; R4 refuses a person's link of a provider account the directory already binds to an agent; R5 refuses delegating from a sign-in identity at DIRECTORY-006 admission; R6 serves the reason 'sign-in identity' on the cannot-give list and chooses the refusal's view at the grant seam; R7 is the one test over the store. Every path is relative to the repository root (CN3).

The rule. The directory refuses, by name, every act that would give an agent a sign-in identity. The refusal names the act, the agent and the sign-in identity, and states that sign-in identities belong to people only. Nothing an agent holds or presents is ever a person's sign-in session or token. A sign-in identity is a provider account linked to a person in the directory, and only that is refused. An agent's own machine account, bound to the agent and to no person, is a service account under row 1.3's separate list, and registering it as the agent's issuer-subject binding under DIRECTORY-003 R1 is allowed. A provider account already linked to a person is refused for an agent by name. An issuer and subject is bound to one holder in the directory, whichever came first: when a person links a provider account whose issuer and subject the directory already binds to an agent, the person's link is refused by name, stating that the account is an agent's own account, the agent's binding stands, and nothing is removed or flagged. That refusal names the agent to the agent's responsible person and to directory administrators, and withholds it from the person trying to link: the person linking is told that the account is an agent's own account and may not be linked to a person, and no agent id, name or responsible person is in that refusal. The refusal is recorded in the directory's history, and there the agent is named, so the responsible person and an administrator read which agent holds the binding. The words' 'each refusal writes nothing to the directory' governs the two acts that would give an agent a sign-in identity; the reverse-order refusal is a person's act and is recorded.

Acceptance, as corrected by the lead's ruling. Linking a provider account to an agent is refused by name; delegating from a sign-in identity to an agent is refused by name; each refusal writes nothing to the directory; and no agent record in the directory ever carries a sign-in identity, checked by one test over the store after the two directory refusals. The third refusal, a credential request for an agent that presents a person's sign-in token refused by name, is the broker's finding (finding 1).

The named exception. The exception stays: it is the standing ruling this brief does not overturn, recorded at docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:43 and docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:167 and docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md:18 (SECRETS-002 R5), and it is the one named exception. The harness login token reaches a seat's process under that ruling, and it never passes through anything lys issues, links or delegates. The rule governs everything lys itself gives an agent. The token is not redefined, and the brief does not pretend it is something other than what it is.

Finding 1, against SECRETS-002, carried by the broker's card. Issuing credentials is the broker's, so the third refusal is a rule the broker enforces. Its acceptance line, for the broker's card to carry: the broker refuses to issue an agent any credential derived from a person's sign-in session; a credential request for an agent that presents a person's sign-in token is refused by name and issues nothing. Row 1.2 is met in full only when that line passes.

Finding 2, against DIRECTORY-004, carried by DIRECTORY-004 and the fork-owned brief it waits on. DIRECTORY-004's ID001_LINK_REFUSAL sees only Rauthy, so it cannot see an agent's binding in the directory. The finding: the link path consults the directory's bindings before the fork links, by asking R4's check with the issuer-subject pair. The acceptance line for the reverse order is carried here, by R4.

The screen. The server's reason is this brief's, and the screen is row 2.4's. Apollo's card jAfmblAP carries the cannot-give list with its four reasons, sign-in identity among them, on the delegation screen. This brief asserts that the server returns the reason 'sign-in identity' for such an entry (R6), and names jAfmblAP as where a person sees it. No screen work is duplicated here. The reason is a property of the source, not of the recipient: a sign-in identity is not a thing anyone is given, person or agent, so the server returns it whoever the recipient is.

In: the classification, the refusal and its two views, the binding refusal with the agent's own account accepted, the reverse-order link refusal, the delegation refusal, the cannot-give reason and the store test. Out: the broker's refusal (finding 1), the fork-side call (finding 2), any screen, any change to docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md, to IDENTITY-001 or to SECRETS-002, and any change to lys-core or a published wire format.

## Requirements

### R1: Classify an issuer-subject pair from the directory's signed history

THE SYSTEM SHALL classify an issuer-subject pair, from the directory's signed events, as exactly one of: a sign-in identity (linked to a person, naming that person), an agent's own account (bound to an agent and to no person, naming that agent), or unbound. A person's registration binding and every provider link the DIRECTORY-003 R4 receiver has recorded count as linked to a person; a link the receiver records as removed no longer does. WHILE the receiver holds a link operation naming the pair that is not yet reconciled into a signed event, THE SYSTEM SHALL classify the pair as unreconciled, never as unbound (P5). The classification SHALL be derived from the replayed log, so it is the same after reopen. It SHALL NOT use email, display name or provider-side account labels to decide anything (P1), and SHALL NOT read any state outside the directory's log and the receiver's pending operations.

**Acceptance:**
- With issuer https://accounts.google.com and subject g-100 linked to person P, the classifier returns sign-in identity naming P, and after the store is closed and reopened it still returns sign-in identity naming P.
- With issuer https://accounts.google.com and subject svc-a bound to agent A and to no person, the classifier returns agent's own account naming A.
- A pair with issuer https://accounts.google.com and subject g-999 that no event names returns unbound, including when P's recorded email is the email of the g-999 account in the fixture.
- With the receiver holding a received, unreconciled link operation of issuer https://github.com subject gh-300 to person P, the classifier returns unreconciled.
- The test counts the four classes it exercised and asserts the count is 4.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/sign_in_identity.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/sign_in_classification.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/lib.rs

**Checklist:**
- C313 — Binding to an agent a provider account linked to a person is refused by name and writes nothing, while an agent's own machine account, linked to no person, is accepted as its issuer-subject binding.

**Stories:**
- S136 (Person who signs in, Keeps their sign-in identities to themselves) — As a person who signs in with a provider account, I want the directory to refuse every act that would give that account to an agent, so that no agent can ever hold my sign-in.

### R2: Define the sign-in identity refusal and its two views

THE SYSTEM SHALL define one refusal for acts that would give a sign-in identity away. It names the act (link to an agent, or delegate), the recipient and its kind (agent or person), and the sign-in identity (provider and subject), and it states the literal sentence 'sign-in identities belong to people only'. WHEN the refusal is returned to the sign-in identity's owner or to a directory administrator (DIRECTORY-003 R3), THE SYSTEM SHALL show the provider and subject. WHEN it is returned to anyone else, THE SYSTEM SHALL show the act, the recipient and its kind, and that a sign-in identity is involved, and SHALL state the literal sentence 'sign-in identities belong to people only'. The view for anyone else SHALL NOT carry the provider or the subject in any form: not in its text, its Display, its Debug, its serialised response or its error code, which SHALL be the same whichever provider and subject are involved, as DIRECTORY-006 R5 requires of a why-refused response.

**Acceptance:**
- For act delegate, recipient agent A, sign-in identity issuer https://accounts.google.com subject g-100 owned by P: the view returned to P contains https://accounts.google.com, g-100 and the literal sentence 'sign-in identities belong to people only', and the view returned to the configured administrator contains https://accounts.google.com and g-100.
- The same refusal returned to person Q contains the act delegate, agent A, the kind agent, the words sign-in identity and the literal sentence 'sign-in identities belong to people only', and neither https://accounts.google.com nor g-100 appears in any of its Display, its Debug and its serialised JSON.
- The views returned to Q of two refusals that differ only in the sign-in identity (issuer https://accounts.google.com subject g-100, and issuer https://github.com subject gh-200) serialise to byte-identical JSON with the same error code.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/src/sign_in_refusal.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/sign_in_refusal_views.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/lib.rs

**Checklist:**
- C317 — A sign-in identity refusal shows the provider and subject to the identity's owner and a directory administrator only; anyone else sees the act, the recipient and that a sign-in identity is involved.

**Stories:**
- S139 (Person who signs in, Keeps their sign-in identities to themselves) — As a person who signs in with a provider account, I want refusals shown to other callers never to reveal my provider or subject, so that my sign-in account is not disclosed through someone else's refused request.
- S140 (Directory administrator, Resolves a refused act) — As a directory administrator, I want a refusal to show me the provider and subject involved, and which agent holds a binding a person tried to link, so that I can tell which account and which agent a refused act touched.

### R3: Refuse a person's provider account as an agent's binding and accept an agent's own machine account

WHEN a caller asks the DIRECTORY-003 R1 binding API to bind an issuer-subject pair to an agent, and R1 classifies the pair as a sign-in identity, THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse with R2's refusal for the act link to an agent, naming the agent and the sign-in identity, and SHALL write no event. This holds whether the agent's responsible person is the sign-in identity's owner or anyone else. IF R1 classifies the pair as unreconciled, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse by name that the pair's link state is not yet reconciled, and SHALL write no event (P5). WHEN R1 classifies the pair as unbound, THE SYSTEM SHALL accept it as the agent's own machine account, a service account under row 1.3's separate list, as DIRECTORY-003 R1 does. The refusal sits in the binding module DIRECTORY-003 R1 lands, where the binding is admitted, and not in the crate root. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT withdraw, move or alter any existing binding to make room, and SHALL NOT manufacture a human login for the agent (P3).

**Acceptance:**
- Binding issuer https://accounts.google.com subject svc-a, linked to no person, to agent A is accepted: the log gains exactly one event and R1 then returns agent's own account naming A.
- Binding issuer https://accounts.google.com subject g-100, linked to person P, to agent A whose responsible person is P is refused with the sign-in identity refusal naming act link to an agent, agent A and the sign-in identity, and the log's length and the projection's digest are unchanged.
- The same binding to agent B whose responsible person is Q is refused the same way, and the log's length and the projection's digest are unchanged.
- Binding issuer https://github.com subject gh-300, whose link to P the receiver holds unreconciled, to agent A is refused by name as not yet reconciled, and the log's length and the projection's digest are unchanged.
- The test counts one accepted case and three refused cases, and asserts both counts.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/sign_in_agent_binding.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/bindings.rs

**Checklist:**
- C313 — Binding to an agent a provider account linked to a person is refused by name and writes nothing, while an agent's own machine account, linked to no person, is accepted as its issuer-subject binding.

**Stories:**
- S136 (Person who signs in, Keeps their sign-in identities to themselves) — As a person who signs in with a provider account, I want the directory to refuse every act that would give that account to an agent, so that no agent can ever hold my sign-in.
- S138 (Person who signs in, Keeps their sign-in identities to themselves) — As an agent's responsible person, I want my agent's own machine account accepted as its binding and kept as the agent's, so that the agent has its own service account without holding anyone's sign-in.

### R4: Refuse a person's link of a provider account the directory binds to an agent

WHEN the link path asks the directory, by issuer-subject pair, whether a person may link that provider account, and R1 classifies the pair as an agent's own account, THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse by name for the act link to a person, stating that the account is an agent's own account and may not be linked to a person, and SHALL record the refusal as one signed entry in the directory's history that names the person trying to link, the issuer-subject pair and the agent holding the binding. THE SYSTEM SHALL show which agent holds the binding only to that agent's responsible person and to a directory administrator (DIRECTORY-003 R3), the same split DIRECTORY-006 R5 makes for a sign-in identity's provider and subject. The refusal returned for the person trying to link SHALL NOT carry the agent's id, the agent's name or the agent's responsible person in any form, and the history entry read as that person SHALL NOT name the agent. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT remove, flag, move or alter the agent's binding, SHALL NOT write any event other than that one history entry, and SHALL answer only a caller authenticated as the link-audit source the DIRECTORY-003 R4 receiver already admits. WHEN the pair is bound to no agent, THE SYSTEM SHALL answer that the directory holds no agent binding for it, SHALL write no event, and SHALL NOT decide anything the fork's own refusals decide (DIRECTORY-004 R1). The check is served by the standalone identity server beside the receiver; the fork-side call that asks it is finding 2 in the task.

**Acceptance:**
- With issuer https://github.com subject gh-7 bound to agent B, named build-bot and responsible person Q, as B's own account, the check asked for person P returns the refusal naming act link to a person and stating that the account is an agent's own account and may not be linked to a person; the log gains exactly one entry, the refusal's history entry, and R1 still returns agent's own account naming B.
- A search of the body returned for P in that refusal finds neither B's agent id nor the name build-bot nor Q's id: zero matches for each.
- The refusal's history entry read as the configured administrator names agent B, and the same entry read as Q names agent B.
- The same history entry read as P finds neither B's agent id nor the name build-bot: zero matches for each.
- The check for issuer https://github.com subject gh-8, bound to no agent, returns that the directory holds no agent binding for it, and the log's length is unchanged.
- An unauthenticated caller is refused by name, receives no answer about gh-7, and the log's length is unchanged.
- A caller authenticated as the configured administrator, which is not the link-audit source, is refused by name, receives no answer about gh-7, and the log's length is unchanged.
- The test counts the four checks it drove (gh-7 for P, gh-8, unauthenticated, administrator) and the three history reads (administrator, Q, P), and asserts the counts are 4 and 3.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/src/sign_in_link_check.rs
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/tests/sign_in_link_check.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity-server/src/routes.rs

**Checklist:**
- C314 — A person's link of a provider account the directory already binds to an agent is refused by name, stating that the account is an agent's own account; the agent's binding stands, and the agent is named in the directory's history to its responsible person and a directory administrator, never to the person trying to link.

**Stories:**
- S138 (Person who signs in, Keeps their sign-in identities to themselves) — As an agent's responsible person, I want my agent's own machine account accepted as its binding and kept as the agent's, so that the agent has its own service account without holding anyone's sign-in.
- S140 (Directory administrator, Resolves a refused act) — As a directory administrator, I want a refusal to show me the provider and subject involved, and which agent holds a binding a person tried to link, so that I can tell which account and which agent a refused act touched.

### R5: Refuse delegating from a sign-in identity at grant admission, for every recipient

WHEN a delegation request reaches DIRECTORY-006 R2 admission and its offered source resolves in the directory to a person's sign-in identity rather than to a grant, THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse with R2's refusal for the act delegate, naming the recipient, the recipient's kind and the sign-in identity, before any mutation, whether the recipient is an agent or a person. The offered source is the value in the request's source grant member of DIRECTORY-006 R1's contract. Admission SHALL resolve that value before its unknown-parent refusal: a value that names a grant resolves to that grant, and a value that is an issuer-subject pair, in the form DIRECTORY-003 R1 uses for an external binding, which R1 of this brief classifies as a sign-in identity, resolves to that sign-in identity. IF R1 classifies the offered issuer-subject pair as unreconciled, THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL refuse by name that the pair's link state is not yet reconciled, before any mutation, and SHALL NOT answer it as unbound (P5). WHEN R1 classifies the pair as unbound or as an agent's own account, the pair is not a sign-in identity and names no grant, so admission SHALL refuse it with DIRECTORY-006's own unknown-parent refusal, before any mutation, and SHALL NOT refuse it with the sign-in identity refusal. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT add a source kind or any member to DIRECTORY-006 R1's grant contract to do this. A service-access grant consented through the same provider account the person signs in with is a separate record (SECRETS-002 R4); THE SYSTEM SHALL admit or refuse it by DIRECTORY-006's own rules only, and SHALL NOT refuse it because it shares an account with a sign-in identity.

**Acceptance:**
- Person P, who signs in with issuer https://accounts.google.com subject g-100, sends a delegation request to P's agent A whose source grant member holds issuer https://accounts.google.com subject g-100: refused with the sign-in identity refusal naming act delegate, recipient A and kind agent; the log's length and the projection's digest are unchanged.
- P sends the same request to person Q: refused with the sign-in identity refusal naming act delegate, recipient Q and kind person; the log's length and the projection's digest are unchanged.
- P sends a delegation request to agent A whose source grant member holds issuer https://github.com subject gh-300, whose link to P the receiver holds unreconciled: refused by name as not yet reconciled, not with the sign-in identity refusal; the log's length and the projection's digest are unchanged.
- P sends a delegation request to agent A whose source grant member holds issuer https://accounts.google.com subject svc-a, bound to agent A as its own account: refused with DIRECTORY-006's unknown-parent refusal, not with the sign-in identity refusal; the log's length and the projection's digest are unchanged.
- P holds a Google Drive service-access grant consented through issuer https://accounts.google.com subject g-100, with pass-on authority for agents; P delegates it to agent A: accepted, exactly one grant event is written, and A's new grant names the Drive grant as its source.
- The test counts four refusals (two sign-in identity, one not yet reconciled, one unknown parent) and one acceptance, and asserts both counts.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/grant_sign_in_identity.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity/src/grants/admission.rs

**Checklist:**
- C315 — Delegating from a sign-in identity is refused by name for an agent recipient and for a person recipient, while a service-access grant consented through the same provider account is admitted by the grant rules alone.

**Stories:**
- S136 (Person who signs in, Keeps their sign-in identities to themselves) — As a person who signs in with a provider account, I want the directory to refuse every act that would give that account to an agent, so that no agent can ever hold my sign-in.
- S137 (Person who signs in, Keeps their sign-in identities to themselves) — As a person delegating to an agent or another person, I want my sign-in identities listed as things I cannot give with the reason 'sign-in identity', so that I know why they are never offered.

### R6: Serve the reason 'sign-in identity' on the cannot-give list and choose the refusal's view at the grant seam

WHEN a person asks DIRECTORY-006 R5's explanation seam what they cannot give to a recipient, THE SYSTEM SHALL list each of that person's sign-in identities with the reason 'sign-in identity', whoever the recipient is, agent or person, because the reason is a property of the source and not of the recipient. THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT list another person's sign-in identities to them. WHEN the grant seam returns R5's refusal, THE SYSTEM SHALL choose R2's view by the caller: the owner and a directory administrator see the provider and subject, and anyone else sees the view without them. The list is shown to a person by Cambium card jAfmblAP on the delegation screen; THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT add or change any screen file.

**Acceptance:**
- Person P with sign-in identities issuer https://accounts.google.com subject g-100 and issuer https://github.com subject gh-200 asks what P cannot give to agent A: the response lists exactly those two, each with reason sign-in identity.
- The same question with recipient person Q lists the same two, each with reason sign-in identity.
- Q's sign-in identity issuer https://accounts.google.com subject g-300 appears in neither of P's responses.
- Agent A, holding pass-on authority from P, asks the grant seam to delegate from P's sign-in identity g-100 to agent B: the body A receives contains neither https://accounts.google.com nor g-100; the same refusal read by P contains both, and the same refusal read by the configured administrator contains both.
- The brief's diff changes no file under surface/.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity-server/tests/grant_cannot_give.rs
- modify: crates/lys-identity-server/src/grants.rs

**Checklist:**
- C316 — The explanation seam lists each of a person's sign-in identities on the cannot-give list with the reason 'sign-in identity', whoever the recipient is.
- C317 — A sign-in identity refusal shows the provider and subject to the identity's owner and a directory administrator only; anyone else sees the act, the recipient and that a sign-in identity is involved.

**Stories:**
- S137 (Person who signs in, Keeps their sign-in identities to themselves) — As a person delegating to an agent or another person, I want my sign-in identities listed as things I cannot give with the reason 'sign-in identity', so that I know why they are never offered.
- S139 (Person who signs in, Keeps their sign-in identities to themselves) — As a person who signs in with a provider account, I want refusals shown to other callers never to reveal my provider or subject, so that my sign-in account is not disclosed through someone else's refused request.
- S140 (Directory administrator, Resolves a refused act) — As a directory administrator, I want a refusal to show me the provider and subject involved, and which agent holds a binding a person tried to link, so that I can tell which account and which agent a refused act touched.

### R7: Prove over the store that no agent record carries a sign-in identity

After the two directory refusals, linking a provider account to an agent (R3) and delegating from a sign-in identity to an agent (R5), one test over the store SHALL enumerate every agent record, from the projection and again from a replay of the log after reopen, and SHALL find that no agent's binding is classified by R1 as a sign-in identity and that no grant an agent holds has a sign-in identity as its source. The test SHALL NOT pass over zero agents or zero refusals: it counts the agent records it inspected and the refusals it drove, and asserts both.

**Acceptance:**
- The test drives three refusals: binding issuer https://accounts.google.com subject g-100, linked to person P, to agent A (responsible person P); binding it to agent B (responsible person Q); and P delegating from it to agent A. Around each it records the log's length and the projection's digest, finds the two values equal, and asserts it counted 3 refusals.
- After the three refusals and R3's accepted binding of issuer https://accounts.google.com subject svc-a to agent A, the test inspects every agent record, asserts it inspected 2, and finds for each agent zero bindings classified as a sign-in identity and zero held grants whose source is a sign-in identity.
- After the store is closed and reopened, the same enumeration over the replayed log inspects 2 agent records and finds the same zero counts.

**Files:**
- create: crates/lys-identity/tests/sign_in_store.rs

**Checklist:**
- C318 — Each refusal of an act that would give an agent a sign-in identity leaves the log and projection unchanged, and one counted test over the store after the two directory refusals finds no agent record carrying a sign-in identity.

**Stories:**
- S136 (Person who signs in, Keeps their sign-in identities to themselves) — As a person who signs in with a provider account, I want the directory to refuse every act that would give that account to an agent, so that no agent can ever hold my sign-in.

## Boundaries

- SHALL NOT change docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.md or docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md (CN1).
- SHALL NOT change SECRETS-002 or the harness login token exception, and SHALL NOT redefine that token as anything other than what it is.
- SHALL NOT build the broker's refusal (finding 1) or any credential issuance; issuance is the broker's (ADR-001).
- SHALL NOT add a seam that exists only to refuse: the refusals sit in the binding seam DIRECTORY-003 owns, the admission and explanation seams DIRECTORY-006 owns, and the directory's side of the link path, whose fork side is finding 2.
- SHALL NOT add or change any screen file; the cannot-give list is shown by Cambium card jAfmblAP.
- SHALL NOT change any file under vendor/rauthy.
- SHALL NOT change lys-core, its published wire formats or lys/delegation/v1, and SHALL NOT add a member or source kind to DIRECTORY-006 R1's grant contract.
- SHALL NOT refuse an agent's own machine account, linked to no person, as its DIRECTORY-003 R1 binding.
- SHALL NOT withdraw, move, flag or alter any existing binding or grant to make a refused act succeed.
- SHALL NOT change any existing brief's id, requirements, estimates or dependency order.

## Verification

- From the repository root: sh scripts/design/gate.sh exits 0.
- At implementation time, from the exact revision, each command exits 0: cargo fmt --all; cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps --all-features; cargo doc --no-deps. Report each refusal case and each counted leg the tests exercised.
- Drift injection, each failing exactly one test file, the one built for the check, and no other. First: make R2's view for anyone else carry an error code that varies with the sign-in identity's provider and subject without containing either; exactly one test file fails, crates/lys-identity/tests/sign_in_refusal_views.rs (its byte-identical case), because no other test compares those views across two sign-in identities. Second: make R4's refusal returned for the person trying to link carry the agent's id; exactly one test file fails, crates/lys-identity-server/tests/sign_in_link_check.rs, because no other test drives R4. Revert both.
- Before reporting row 1.2 passed, confirm the broker's card carries finding 1's acceptance line and that it passes; until then row 1.2 is reported as tested in part by this card and awaiting the broker.
