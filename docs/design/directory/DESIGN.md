# The standalone identity directory, with every grant rooted in a person

> **Cluster:** directory

## Intention

An operator installs the identity product without Cambium or Manifold, signs in, links Google and GitHub to one person, registers an agent under a responsible person, and inspects the signed history of every identity change.

## Problem

IDENTITY-001 revision 5 is the reviewed plan for this, in the older row form, and it predates Tom's ruling of 22 September 17:15 that every grant is pegged to a human authority, his PostgreSQL ruling of 23 September 14:14, and the working lifecycle states. Its row 02 installs SpiceDB without saying what it enforces. It cannot be dispatched to the design-system loop as it stands.

## Solution

Carry IDENTITY-001's open rows (02, 04, 03, 05) into design-system briefs in this cluster, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, revised for the grant ruling (ADR-003), the PostgreSQL ruling (ADR-005) and the working lifecycle states (ADR-011, proposed), with the fork (ADR-009) and the product accents (ADR-010) in the project ledger and every decision still open for Tom marked open. The IDENTITY-001 files stay as they are, as the record of revision 5. DIRECTORY-007 writes the audit receipt every sign-in and every permission change leaves: IDENTITY-001's shared contract carried as written, signed by the service that performed the operation, returned beside the signed event the log holds, verified offline by lys log verify receipt (ADR-025), for changes only (ADR-024), with a development install emitting test receipts under a test key and a test tag (ADR-026); its receipt crate crates/lys-receipt and its CLI subcommand are wholly new modules with exact manifests, its sign-in receipts live in the directory service, and DIRECTORY-003, DIRECTORY-004 and DIRECTORY-006 keep emitting their own receipts.

## Principles

- **P1** — An enduring identity ID is stable through provider additions, key rotation and later sessions; issuer plus subject identifies an external login; email and display name never establish identity equivalence.
- **P2** — Everything is pegged to a human authority: the responsible person's permissions are the ceiling and an agent holds an explicit subset; exercising an act and delegating it are separate grants; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it.
- **P3** — A person or agent may be registered before any session exists; registration creates no running state and issues no Rauthy login, runtime credential or capability certificate.
- **P4** — One signed committed directory event is both the identity change and its audit record; never a database change followed by a best-effort log append.
- **P5** — No success before durable evidence; an uncertain append is reconciled before its projection answers as current, and pending or refused outcomes stay visible until resolved.
- **P6** — A future execution or fork ID refers to its enduring identity and, for a fork, its parent execution; step 1 reserves that distinction in the contract and implements neither session history nor launch.
- **P7** — An audit receipt carries a version, a stable operation ID, the actor, the affected identity, the operation, a payload commitment and the resulting log coordinate or checkpoint; secrets and whole context objects are excluded, and its exact signed encoding is reviewed before use.
- **P8** — The service attests the authenticated human actor and their authentication provenance; it never claims a person signed bytes with a key they do not hold, and a registration records the person who made it, never an invented agent signature.
- **P9** — The initial directory administrator is bootstrapped by an explicitly configured issuer and subject, never by email or first visitor; every other mutation caller is refused in step 1.

## Decisions

- ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
- ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
- ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL, possibly on a network device — PostgreSQL is used for the identity product's database. It may be set up on one of the network devices rather than on Tom's Mac.
- ADR-007 — The product starts an agent by giving its start command, never by running it — The product is not an execution engine. For the first release an agent's file gives the command that starts it on a chosen machine: the command carries the agent's identity and its handles, never a credential's value, and it is rendered from the agent's kept launch record. A started agent reports back, so the sessions screen shows what is running. A terminal inside the product, sandboxes, virtual machines and containers are later runtimes that plug in, and none is built into this product.
- ADR-008 — An agent's file shows its lys certificate — An agent's file shows its lys certificate once one is issued: what it claims, who signed it, when it was issued and when it expires, with the signed receipts of the changes made to it. An agent registered before any key or proof of possession was supplied shows its certificate as not issued, never a placeholder.
- ADR-009 — People sign in through a maintained Rauthy fork of our own — Rauthy authenticates people, and its one-provider-per-user limit is changed in a fork we maintain, ablative-io/rauthy, not contributed upstream as a prerequisite. The maintained branch is ablative, created from upstream v0.36.2 commit dd61ac3c84d6b238108dc8438b53043b5177a662; the fork's main stays an untouched upstream mirror; lys pins an exact commit of ablative as the submodule vendor/rauthy. Upgrades rebase ablative onto upstream release tags only, each in its own gated row; no cherry-picks and no reset of main.
- ADR-010 — Every product shares one design and keeps its own accent; the identity product's is orange — The identity screens follow Aion's structure, typography, spacing and interaction, and Rauthy's client themes take the same colours, with no build dependency on Cambium or Aion. Each product keeps its own accent within the estate colour family: Cambium green, Aion blue and black, Argus light blue, Haematite mustard. The identity product's accent is orange (accent #D4975A, deep #A86B2E, wash #3D2A17 in the estate colour tokens), set apart from Manifold's copper. No product is silently made Aion-blue, and purple is not used.
- ADR-011 — An identity is registered, active, suspended or retired — An identity is in one of four states: registered (exists in the directory, no grants, no credential handle, may not act), active (may act within its grants), suspended (kept whole, grants kept but not effective) and retired (permanent, history kept, never reactivated; a new identity is made instead). Register, activate, suspend, reinstate and retire are the only transitions, each one signed audit record naming the authenticated actor and their provenance, the identity, from, to, when and reason. Having a grant or a credential is a fact beside the state, not a state. A person is registered by first sign-in; an agent is registered by a signed-in person, who carries it as its responsible person for life and may cause every transition of their own agents. Source: docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:17-44 and docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:71-95.
- ADR-024 — Audit receipts are for changes only; answered permission checks go to step 2's separate access record — Receipts are for changes only. A check that is answered and changes nothing is not a receipt. When step 2 brings enforcement, allows and refusals go into a separate access record that step 2 defines: refusals are always recorded there, and whether allows are too is decided with step 2. Rejected: every answered check as a signed receipt in the lys log, and deferring the question to the build.
- ADR-025 — The receipt verifier lives in the lys CLI, offline, needing only the log and the service's public key — The verifier lives in the lys CLI, as lys log verify receipt, offline, needing only the log directory and the service's public key. Changing the published lys binary for this is accepted; the release that carries it is a separate, deliberate act after docs/design/identity/IDENTITY-EVENTS.md's envelope version is ratified and recorded, never before, because publishing a crate that exposes a format freezes it (CLAUDE.md:78-80). Rejected: a verifier inside the directory service, which would be checking the service with the service and defeats the point of an independent audit.
- ADR-026 — A development install emits test receipts under a test key and a test tag, and a real key never verifies one — A development install emits test receipts, signed with a test key and carrying a test tag, inside IDENTITY-001's development isolation, and never performs the reserved act. The verifier refuses a test-tagged receipt by name unless it is given the test key explicitly, and a real key never verifies a test receipt, so a test receipt never passes as real. Harness tests stay as well. Rejected: a development install that emits no receipts, and reading its receipts as the reserved act.

## Goals

- Every open row of IDENTITY-001 (02, 04, 03, 05) exists as a valid design-system brief in this cluster, DIRECTORY-002 to DIRECTORY-005, in its dependency order, every ID001 acceptance identifier kept.
- The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement of the row that owns it, with acceptance criteria; where the sources do not settle the row, it is recorded open for Tom in DIRECTORY-003 with its criteria drafted.
- Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open and decided nowhere in this cluster.
- The two live demonstrations to Tom, ID001_LINK_LIVE and ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE, stay hold points a loop completion never replaces (CN6).
- DIRECTORY-006 makes the grant/refusal journey enforceable and binds its acceptance to the reviewed mock-up, without rewriting the historical IDENTITY-001 record.
- DIRECTORY-007 leaves one verifiable receipt for every sign-in and permission change, verified offline from the log and the service's key alone, with receipts for changes only and test receipts that never pass as real.

## Non-Goals

- Rows 06 (connect Cambium) and 07 (gate, install and demonstrate the release) — They change the Cambium repository and depend on IDENTITY-002, the upstream release rebase; they need a Cambium cluster or an agreed cross-repository arrangement first.
- Row 03's changes inside the Rauthy fork — The fork is its own repository under vendor/rauthy; a row whose files live there needs its own brief in the fork, which does not yet exist and blocks DIRECTORY-004. DIRECTORY-004 names the fork files as work with their owner, not as files of this repository.
- The grant representation: how one grant records who may exercise it, whether it may be passed on (person, agent or nobody), what it derives from, and whether it can be bounded. OPEN for Tom. — The statement leaves the exact delegation schema unsettled (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:21; ADR-003); AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23's questions (docs/design/identity/AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md:17-23) are inputs to it, not answers.
- Suspension semantics: whether suspending a person also ends their sign-in session at Rauthy or only makes our checks refuse, and what else stops with a suspended identity. OPEN for Tom. — The lifecycle document asks it of the room (docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:99-100, docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:104-105) and its states are only proposed (ADR-011); two systems, one decision.
- The name of the identity service. OPEN for Tom. — The statement lists it as not decided (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:192); no crate or directory name selects it.
- Which anchor the first agents pin to: our hosted anchor, a self-hosted one, or both. OPEN for Tom. — Lys leaves it as a product decision and so does the statement (docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:193).
- A nightly Rauthy base versus waiting for an upstream release carrying #1696 and #1728. OPEN for Tom. — Waffles' ruling of 15:36:25: if upstream has published no such release by the row 05 showing, Tom decides (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:18; docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md:177); rows 02 to 05 run on v0.36.2 meanwhile.
- Road step 2 onward: capability certificates, arbitrary grants and their enforcement, session launch and stop, credential handles, memory, context assembly, lanterns and anchoring in production — Revision 5 keeps them out of step 1 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:29-30); ADR-007 (the start command) and ADR-008 (the certificate on an agent's file) govern what the step-1 screens do not present as working.
- The examples in AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23 (abilities with an assignment or project, seat provisioning within a budget, private and shared notes) — Tom gave them as not yet decided (docs/design/identity/AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md:11-15); they are never turned into requirements.
- A production Cambium auth cutover, and any upstream Rauthy contribution as a prerequisite — Revision 5 forbids both before scratch acceptance, review and Gypsy's coordinated install (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:31).
- A shared design-system package extracted for every product — Tom left it as a thing to look at, not a row (ADR-010).
- Step 2's access record, where answered permission checks are recorded. — W1 (ADR-024): receipts are for changes only; when step 2 brings enforcement, allows and refusals go into a separate access record that step 2 defines, refusals always, allows decided with step 2. Nothing in DIRECTORY-007 records an answered check.
- Receipts for refusals Rauthy makes itself: a bad password, a failed provider callback. — They never reach the directory service, Rauthy's native events are asynchronous and severity-filtered (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.md:44), and a signing key inside Rauthy is a fork change under ADR-009 that no brief of this repository makes (A4); sign-in receipts cover what the directory service records and refuses.
- A receipt verifier inside the directory service. — W2 (ADR-025): a verifier that needs the running service would be checking the service with the service; the verifier lives in the lys CLI, offline.
- The lys release that carries the receipt verifier. — A separate, deliberate act after IDENTITY-EVENTS.md's envelope version is ratified and recorded, never before, because publishing a crate that exposes a format freezes it (CLAUDE.md:78-80, A10); landing DIRECTORY-007 R3 on main publishes nothing.
- A separate agent-provisioning receipt. — Provisioned is a view over grants and a handle, not a transition (docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md:26-28); an agent's provisioning shows as its register transition and then its grants (A5).
- The grant receipt's payload and its test legs. — They cover exactly the grant representation, which is OPEN for Tom above, and stay with DIRECTORY-006 GRANT_AUDIT; DIRECTORY-007 commits only to the contract's seven fields (A6).
- A state-based sign-in refusal, and a receipt for one, in step 1. — Lifecycle state is recorded and not enforced in step 1 (CN11, DIRECTORY-003 R5); the step-2 refusals arrive with enforcement and suspension semantics stay OPEN for Tom (A11).

## Inventory

- `docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json` — IDENTITY-001 revision 5, the reviewed plan these briefs carry forward: rows, walls, acceptance identifiers (ID001_*), estimates, authority and review decisions. Read, never changed.
- `docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.md` — its rendered twin
- `docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md` — the authority, including 'Everything is pegged to a human authority (Tom, 17:15 to 17:16)'
- `docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md` — the working lifecycle states: registered, active, suspended, retired
- `docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md` — provisioning an agent under a human, the seven-step path
- `docs/design/identity/AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md` — Tom's 23 September ruling: 'If a human can do it through the UI, then I want an agent to be able to do it'; whether an agent may is a permission question. Input to the directory and permission rows. Its examples are recorded as undecided and are never turned into requirements.
- `docs/design/identity/RAUTHY-BASELINE.md` — the fork baseline: pin, maintenance owner, the IDENTITY-001-UPSTREAM-AUTH-STATE blocker; read, never changed
- `docs/design/identity/CONFORMANCE.md` — Accepted mock-up behaviour map; DIRECTORY-006 maps You/delegation/access requirements and does not claim mock-up sample policy is authoritative.
- `crates/lys/src/commands/log/verify.rs` — lys log verify inclusion and consistency: the published discipline the receipt verifier keeps, pre-crypto refusals named, every cryptographic or structural failure one generic message per artifact class (lines 7-14). Unchanged by DIRECTORY-007.
- `crates/lys/src/commands/error.rs` — CliError, with LogInclusionVerificationFailed and LogConsistencyVerificationFailed at lines 189-196 as the pattern; DIRECTORY-007 R3 appends ReceiptNeedsTestKey and ReceiptVerificationFailed and changes no existing variant.
- `crates/lys-log-store/src/store.rs` — the LeafStore trait (lines 120-141): origin, extent and leaf, which the receipt verifier reads through; it never opens a Log, whose open may write a repaired pin (crates/lys-log-store/src/log.rs:99).
- `crates/lys-core/src/checkpoint/verifier_key.rs` — NoteVerifierKey::from_spec (line 92): the ORIGIN+KEYID_HEX+KEY_BASE64 key string the CLI's verify commands take; the receipt verifier parses --verifier-key and --test-key with it.
- `docs/design/lys-anchor/DECISIONS.md` — lines 333-335: the three acts reserved for Tom, publishing lys-anchor, generating a production anchor key, emitting any receipt outside a test. Read, never changed.
- `CLAUDE.md` — lines 78-80: a format is frozen once a signature is produced or a leaf is logged under it; a new version alongside, never a mutation. Governs the lys release that carries the verifier.

## Constraints

- **CN1** — Documents only: nothing outside docs/design/directory/ and docs/design/decisions.json is created or modified; the IDENTITY-001 files are not changed.
- **CN2** — Development isolation: rows 02 to 05 use only disposable test identities and test provider registrations; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration.
- **CN3** — Every path written in a document of this cluster is relative to the repository root, whatever directory a session starts in; a command runs from its own tree and spells its paths from there.
- **CN4** — No structure row or files entry carries a root token; a file in another repository is named in a requirement's spec with its owner.
- **CN5** — A live demonstration to Tom is never an acceptance criterion of a loop requirement; it is a verification step a person performs after the row lands.
- **CN6** — The live demonstrations ID001_LINK_LIVE (after row 03) and ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE (after row 05) are mandatory operator hold points: the brief that follows each is blocked by it until Tom's demonstration receipt is recorded; a loop completion never stands in for one.
- **CN7** — Revision 5's ceiling stands: 48 focused implementer hours for IDENTITY-001 (row 01 1.5, closed; 02 8; 04 10; 03 10; 05 6; 06 4; 07 5; total 44.5, contingency 3.5), with IDENTITY-002's 4 hours outside it. An overrun is reported as soon as it is known, and Waffles takes any ceiling change to Tom (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:24).
- **CN8** — One implementer, one row in implementation and one gate invocation at a time in this lane; release builds, checks and tests run through the gate workflow at the venue, and a development exception never bypasses it (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:25-27, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:135).
- **CN9** — A row that needs a file outside its wall stops and names it, and the reviewer approves a brief revision before that file is edited; a directory wall for a wholly new module allows only its named responsibility and needs an exact file manifest reviewed before its row starts (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:28).
- **CN10** — Rows 02 to 05 run on Rauthy v0.36.2 under Waffles' ruling of 15:36:25; each development install checks current releases and advisories and records the accepted exception; IDENTITY-001-UPSTREAM-AUTH-STATE binds real sign-in and install, rows 06 and 07 (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:18, docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:46).
- **CN11** — Step 1 is directory records, sign-in and the minimum signed identity audit. SpiceDB is installed and checked in row 02 and enforces nothing in step 1; live capability policy and its enforcement are step 2's, and running SpiceDB is not permission enforcement (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json:29-30).
- **CN12** — DIRECTORY-006 is implementation work after the frozen planning task: its source paths are only executable after the DIRECTORY-002/003 foundations are implemented and their integration manifests are reconciled. R6 also waits for the standalone surface foundation. Do not dispatch from a schema-valid but dependency-blocked brief.
- **CN13** — An audit receipt is signed by the service that performed the operation, never by the identity it is about; a verifier is given that service's public key and never takes a key the receipt carries as its authority (P8).
- **CN14** — The appended leaf is the signed event, appended in the order the operations happened; the receipt is returned beside it carrying the log coordinate the append yielded and the payload commitment, and is never itself appended (docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.md:49).
- **CN15** — Receipts are for changes only: a permission check that is answered and changes nothing leaves no receipt and never enters the signed receipt log; when step 2 brings enforcement, allows and refusals go to a separate access record step 2 defines, refusals always, allows decided with step 2 (ADR-024).
- **CN16** — A development install emits test receipts, signed with a test key and carrying a test tag, inside development isolation, and never performs the act docs/design/lys-anchor/DECISIONS.md:335 reserves; a verifier refuses a test-tagged receipt by name unless given the test key explicitly, saying to supply it, and a real key never verifies a test receipt, so a test receipt never passes as real; harness tests stay as well (ADR-026).
- **CN17** — The receipt verifier keeps the published discipline of crates/lys/src/commands/log/verify.rs: every cryptographic or structural verification failure collapses to one named refusal class for the receipt artifact, so tamper classes are indistinguishable in the output; the pre-crypto, actionable refusals stay named on their own: malformed JSON, a malformed key string, and a test-tagged receipt presented without the test key.
- **CN18** — The receipt's signed encoding, tag and content type are written in docs/design/identity/IDENTITY-EVENTS.md under its recorded joint review, never in a brief; a code row of the receipt starts only when that file is on main with its version, typed payloads, named commitment hash and recorded review; a lys release carrying the verifier is a separate act after that version is ratified, never before (CLAUDE.md:78-80), and landing on main publishes nothing.
