# The standalone identity directory, with every grant rooted in a person

> **Cluster:** directory

## Intention

An operator installs the identity product without Cambium or Manifold, signs in, links Google and GitHub to one person, registers an agent under a responsible person, and inspects the signed history of every identity change.

## Problem

IDENTITY-001 revision 5 is the reviewed plan for this, in the older row form, and it predates Tom's ruling of 22 September 17:15 that every grant is pegged to a human authority, his PostgreSQL ruling of 23 September 14:14, and the working lifecycle states. Its row 02 installs SpiceDB without saying what it enforces. It cannot be dispatched to the design-system loop as it stands.

## Solution

Carry IDENTITY-001's open rows (02, 04, 03, 05) into design-system briefs in this cluster, revised for the grant ruling, the PostgreSQL ruling and the lifecycle states, with the decisions in the project ledger and every decision still open for Tom marked open. The IDENTITY-001 files stay as they are, as the record of revision 5.

## Principles

- **P1** — An enduring identity ID is stable through provider additions, key rotation and later sessions; issuer plus subject identifies an external login; email and display name never establish identity equivalence.
- **P2** — Everything is pegged to a human authority: the responsible person's permissions are the ceiling and an agent holds an explicit subset; exercising an act and delegating it are separate grants; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it.
- **P3** — A person or agent may be registered before any session exists; registration creates no running state and no credential.
- **P4** — One signed committed directory event is both the identity change and its audit record; never a database change followed by a best-effort log append.
- **P5** — No success before durable evidence; an uncertain append is reconciled before its projection answers as current, and pending or refused outcomes stay visible until resolved.

## Decisions

- ADR-003 — Everything is pegged to a human authority — A person signs in first; an agent is provisioned under that person with its own identity; the person's permissions are the ceiling and the agent holds an explicit subset; every grant says who may exercise it and who may pass it on; withdrawing the authority stops every grant derived from it. The exact delegation schema is not settled by this decision.
- ADR-004 — Manifold is optional and every project stands alone — The engine that starts or ends a seat is whichever one runs the agent: manifold, aion, or a customer's own. Each project in the stack works without the others; an engine without the broker reads its own pool file as it does today.
- ADR-005 — The identity database is PostgreSQL, possibly on a network device — PostgreSQL is used for the identity product's database. It may be set up on one of the network devices rather than on Tom's Mac.

## Goals

- Every open row of IDENTITY-001 (02, 04, 03, 05) exists as a valid design-system brief in this cluster, in its dependency order.
- The grant path (create an agent under a person, grant it a project, the action is allowed, revoke or suspend, the same action is refused) is a requirement of the row that owns it, with acceptance criteria.
- Every decision still open for Tom is recorded as open and decided nowhere in this cluster.

## Non-Goals

- Rows 06 (connect Cambium) and 07 (gate, install and demonstrate the release) — They change the Cambium repository and depend on IDENTITY-002, the upstream release rebase; they need a Cambium cluster or an agreed cross-repository arrangement first.
- Row 03's changes inside the Rauthy fork — The fork is its own repository under vendor/rauthy; a row whose files live there needs its own cluster in the fork. Its brief here records the fork files as named work, not as files of this repository.
- Choosing the grant representation, suspension semantics, the service name or the anchor — Open for Tom.

## Inventory

- `docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.json` — IDENTITY-001 revision 5, the reviewed plan these briefs carry forward: rows, walls, acceptance identifiers (ID001_*), estimates, authority and review decisions. Read, never changed.
- `docs/design/identity/briefs/IDENTITY-001.md` — its rendered twin
- `docs/design/identity/STATEMENT-2026-09-22.md` — the authority, including 'Everything is pegged to a human authority (Tom, 17:15 to 17:16)'
- `docs/design/identity/LIFECYCLE-STATES-2026-09-22.md` — the working lifecycle states: registered, active, suspended, retired
- `docs/design/identity/PROVISIONING-2026-09-22.md` — provisioning an agent under a human, the seven-step path
- `docs/design/identity/AGENT-PARITY-2026-09-23.md` — Tom's 23 September ruling: 'If a human can do it through the UI, then I want an agent to be able to do it'; whether an agent may is a permission question. Input to the directory and permission rows. Its examples are recorded as undecided and are never turned into requirements.

## Constraints

- **CN1** — Documents only: nothing outside docs/design/directory/ and docs/design/decisions.json is created or modified; the IDENTITY-001 files are not changed.
- **CN2** — Development isolation: rows 02 to 05 use only disposable test identities and test provider registrations; no production tokens, real business sign-in or live Cambium participant migration.
- **CN3** — Every path written in a document of this cluster is relative to the repository root, whatever directory a session starts in; a command runs from its own tree and spells its paths from there.
- **CN4** — No structure row or files entry carries a root token; a file in another repository is named in a requirement's spec with its owner.
- **CN5** — A live demonstration to Tom is never an acceptance criterion of a loop requirement; it is a verification step a person performs after the row lands.
- **CN6** — The live demonstrations ID001_LINK_LIVE (after row 03) and ID001_DIRECTORY_LIVE (after row 05) are mandatory operator hold points: the brief that follows each is blocked by it until Tom's demonstration receipt is recorded; a loop completion never stands in for one.
